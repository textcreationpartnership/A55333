            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is a most glorious truth, though consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered but by a few, that Believers have, or may have, distinct communion with the three persons, <hi>Father, Son, and Spirit.</hi> This is attested by the finger of God, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly owned in the first and best age of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: <hi>Truly our fellowship is with the father, and with his son Jesus Christ.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>And as Believers have fellowship with the sacred persons of the Godhead, so there are transgressions which seem more to entrench on one person, than on another: Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, the Holy Ghost is not silent. Yea, I may safely adde, though every sin shall have a due punishment, yet those sins which are committed against the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the third Person, seem to have a more scarlet dye, and deeper tincture of provocation, than other sins; and therefore the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> bears witness in the mouth of <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> that though every bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy
<pb facs="tcp:100920:3"/> against the Son of man, shall bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, yet there are some affronts against the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that shal never. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31. Undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the <hi>Stoicks</hi> Opinion of the equality of all sin, is to be exploded as Antiscriptural. Some sins are as <hi>Camels,</hi> others as <hi>Moats,</hi> others as <hi>Beams, Mat.</hi> 7.3. and such are <hi>Camels</hi> and <hi>Beams,</hi> as grieve, vex, and quench the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>I remember what was said of old, <hi>Periculo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum est de Deo etiam vera dicere:</hi> and indeed there is some kinde of fear upon my spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on comparisons, betwixt <hi>Father, Son, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> Yet we may safely speak by Rule, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, That the company of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is more expedient for Believers, whilst dwelling in their earthly Tabernacles, than is the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> John 16.7. <hi>It is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you that I go away: For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you, but if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, I will send him unto you.</hi> Mark it, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Comforter,</hi> by way of excellency, above the comfort they had by his bodily presence. He can comfort and assist Believers in all places at once, whereas <hi>Christs</hi> bodily presence was confined to one place. It is beyond controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is the choicest gift that ever descended from the bosome of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> and resided among the children of
<pb facs="tcp:100920:3"/> men. We owe our first life to <hi>this inspiration of the Almighty;</hi> and the better life, the second life, the new life; the new man is created and formed by the same blessed Spirit. He is the great spring of all motions God-ward, he <hi>works both to will and to do.</hi> Here then you see how dis-ingenuous it is, to abuse so good a friend, and what folly to distaste so potent a Person, who <hi>thinks it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> We are wont to study a compliance with any, who have obliged us by their respects, or who have power in their hands to crush us in case of any indignities, we put upon them. The Spirit of God is no other than God; he is that <hi>Holy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy</hi> one, who appeared to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> as you may finde by comparing <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.3, 9, 10. with <hi>Act.</hi> 28.25, 26, 27. Who <hi>ever hardned himself against God, and prospered?</hi> What madness is that which the Children of men inherit in all generations, whilst they oppose him, against whom it is impossible to prevail? What are all the Nations in comparison of the great God, but drops? Yea, they are nothing, yea, less than nothing. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.17, Why will the Briars contend with the devouring Fire? Why will the dust of the earth go about to quench this Fire? it will burn the more fiercely. Beleive it, sin receives an accent from the person it affronts: to strike the meanest officer is dangerous, but much more
<pb facs="tcp:100920:4"/> to abuse or strike the Prince. Were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else in sin to make you shun it, yet this were enough, that it is <hi>Deicidium,</hi> that it <hi>quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Spirit</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>If ever God did call his people to weeping and self-abhorrence, now is the time. And I know nothing will help us to obey this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Call, more than to meditate on sin; Sin in its nature, sin in its effects, and sin with all its aggravations. The great stratagem of Hell in this hour of darkness, is to hide sin, and to vail it with profit, pleasure, and honour, that it may not bee seen in its naked deformities. What then is our wisdome and concernment, save to take off all the masks and coverings, all the paint and varnish, with which sin is dawbed? that it may appear exceeding loathsome, and may bee numbred among the most detestable things! Observe your own hearts, and you will finde a strange listlessness and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to this work of <hi>uncasing of sin.</hi> Oh that the blessed God would incline your hearts, and over-power them so far, as to study that word <hi>Sin,</hi> till you abhor that which your hearts are fil'd with. This is the great design that this worthy Author is promoting, the same work which his <hi>Master</hi> is promoting, to alienate the hearts of men from the love of sin. Oh methinks this should prevail with you to sue out a Bill of divorce against your sins, that whilst you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
<pb facs="tcp:100920:4"/> to them, you do not only <hi>grieve,</hi> but <hi>quench</hi> the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>I cannot enough bless the Lord, for fixing the thoughts of this worthy Minister, on such a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as this, in such a day as this, wherein many have <hi>departed from the faith.</hi> Many that were whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the snow, are now blacker than a coa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>▪ many who went in troops to the house of God, are now lifting up their heels against the thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of <hi>Zion.</hi> Multitudes who had sweet turns with Christ, are now become strange to him, and they who had strong affections in duties, are now wholly enslaved to sensuality and worldly prosecutions▪ <hi>Oh my bowels, my bowels!</hi> I am pained at the heart, when I consider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>have left their first love,</hi> how many are with the Dog returned to the vomit, and with the Sow to the mire. Would to God I had the <hi>tongue of Men and Angels,</hi> that I might invite these to <hi>remember from whence they are fall'n,</hi> and to take this glass into their private Closets with them, that they may see how black they are, that were once glorious as the Sun, when it shines forth in its might. Certainly, there are very few into whose hands this <hi>excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise shall fall,</hi> who will bee able to plead <hi>Not guilty</hi> to this <hi>great Indictment,</hi> of quenching the Spirit of God. Had we been formed, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed only in the dark regions of <hi>America,</hi> wee
<pb facs="tcp:100920:5"/> might have been exempted from so great a guilt as now lies on us, who have spent so many years in the <hi>Land of Vision:</hi> Undoubtedly, the more knowledge we have affronted, the more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence we have offered to the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Again, the more will and deliberation accompanies any of our sins, the more presumptuous they are, and the nearer they border on <hi>the great trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,</hi> as appears, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19.13. Again, the greater mercies, favours, and priviledges wee have had from God, the more abuse is offered to the spirit of God. Oh then! how crimson, how bloody are <hi>Englands</hi> sins, especially <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,</hi> their abominations! Oh that the great God would send the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> amongst us, more throughly to convince us of all the guilt, we, and the Land are under. Oh let us lift up our hands to heaven, and cry out with amazing wonder, <hi>Oh Heavens! Oh Earth!</hi> such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as we, who have had such tokens from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, such a glorious Gospel, such ravishing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations of God; who have had such spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dispensations, who have had such light, such vouchsafements, yet carry our selves so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily as we have done! How often hath the blessed spirit allured us, but wee have sinned under his very smiles! How often hath hee frowned on us; See you neglect Closet-prayer no more; be worldly, wanton, passionate, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
<pb facs="tcp:100920:5"/> intemperate no more; at your peril, if you despise my motions and counsels again; yet we have dared God, braved God, and provoked him to do his worst, what care we. Oh won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful patience! that, being like <hi>Er, Judah</hi>'s el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son, being wicked in the sight of the Lord, that the Lord should not make an end of us, as he slew him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.7. Nay, to our great shame bee it written, though wee have sinn'd presumptuously, and faced wonderful light and mercy; though we have wrestled with the spirit, and striven a long while with him, yet we refuse to be ashamed, we are not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with our sins, neither do we watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Now whether the sin be in <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riâ gravi,</hi> or not, yet whilest you pray it not down, and watch it not down, and do your utmost to draw the blood of it; so long it bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at lest on presumptuous sins, and they are the <hi>great transgressions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord would take it kindly at your hands, did you <hi>fight his battles,</hi> did you heartily and constantly oppose that which his soul hates: Yea, though the workings of your hearts be like the reekings of a dunghil, that casts forth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a stinking smell; Yet whilst these vapours of hell are offensive and burthensome to you, so long I conceive the Spirit is not quenched. Though the <hi>Virgin</hi> bee overmatch'd in power,
<pb facs="tcp:100920:6"/> and thereby she is ravish'd; Yet if she consents not, but cries out against the Ruffian, she is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced clear. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.25, 26, 27. Whilest the will consents that the Law is <hi>holy, just, and good,</hi> and calls to the understanding to bring in arguments whereby to oppose sin, the Spirit is not quenched: Though thine affections and lusts begin to grow inordinate, and thy inferiour appetite rebel, yet if you call to Heaven for help, the Spirit will help thee in thy extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not withdraw from thee, whilst the most noble, the superiour faculties, the minde and will stand in defiance against all the solicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Hell and a corrupt heart. Unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sins, such as vain thoughts, sinful risings of heart, vain-glory, covetous, or unclean desires, slavish fears, carking cares; these, if cockered, if cherished, quench the Spirit: But if refused, if thou endeavourest to suppress and quench this <hi>infernal fire,</hi> if thou labourest to pray them down, believe them down, if thou consult faithful Ministers, and submittest to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and directions, for the mortifying of thy lusts, so long thou quenchest not the spirit, but emploiest the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in that work, for which he was sent into the world; <hi>viz.</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the works of the Devil, and of a corrupt nature.</p>
            <p>If you ask me, <hi>Whether the Spirit may not be
<pb facs="tcp:100920:6"/> quenched, though sin be resisted:</hi> I answer, by borrowing a few distinctions from the learned.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a willing and a forced resistance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Willing, when a man with all his heart sets himself against sin; the Spirit of God is not quenched, when there is this resistance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Unwilling, or forced resistance, when through the light of natural Conscience, the checks and gripes thereof, men dare not but oppose their sins, which was the case of <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> he had a minde and an heart to curse Gods people, out of love to the reward, but yet his Conscience resisted. The Spirit may be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where there is but this unwilling resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a constant, and an unconstant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. Where the constant resistance is, the Spirit is not quenched; but when men on a bed of Sickness, or before a Sacrament only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve against their sins, and strive against them, and afterwards return with the Dog to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, the Spirit may quenched, though for the present the soul cries out, <hi>What have I to do with Idols?</hi> Compare <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1. with 4. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.36, 37.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a resistance of sin for high ends, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting <hi>God,</hi> and for lower, respecting <hi>self.</hi> Some may resist sin, and yet quench the spirit, when for fear of losing their credit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or Heaven,
<pb facs="tcp:100920:7"/> they war against sin: But if you resist sin, out of love to Gods name principally, because sin dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours God, and opposeth Gods will, so long the Spirit is not quenched.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a resistance in our own power, and a resistance in the strength of the spirit of <hi>Christ.</hi> When we resist sin in our own strength, wee distrust the spirit, wee put him out of his office, for he is sent <hi>to mortifie the deeds of the flesh, Rom.</hi> 8.13. But if we call in the assistances of heaven to us, if we are sensible of the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power of sin, and how unable we are to hold our ground against it, and thereupon endeavour to get and keep the blessed spirit with us, that there may be a greater, than that He that is in the world; hereby wee are far from quenching the spirit of God. Oh that the Lord would make me an instrument to put you upon this willing, constant resisting of sin, of all sin, (for an hypocrite may resist many sins, to which his temper and interest leads him not) the more you oppose sin, the less you will be involved in this great guilt of quenching the spirit of God. I beseech you also, look carefully to your duties, <hi>stretch out after God</hi> in all of them; be not contented with your rounds, but see whether sin be more hated in and after your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and <hi>Christ</hi> more prized and valued by you; never reckon you pray, read, or meditate aright,
<pb facs="tcp:100920:7"/> till you <hi>clasp about the neck of Jesus Christ;</hi> till he kiss you with the kisses of his lips. If you are quieted by your performances with any thing below <hi>Christ,</hi> you are in danger of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blessed spirit.</p>

I have a great desire thou should'st view the inner rooms, and therefore will not hold thee in the Porch. Only I must tell thee, that though some have overly and slightly touched upon this subject, yet I think none have made it their work to insist on it so fully and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly, as this learned and judicious Author. God hath cast the honour hereof upon him, to make a fuller discovery of the <hi>Evil of quenching the Spirit,</hi> than ever I have heard (save from his mouth) or have seen, save from his pen. And blessed for ever be the Lord, who put it into his heart, to bend his studies this way; and to encline him, and over-rule him to publish that to the world, which but a very few were made happy in the knowledge of. I pray the <hi>Lord of influences</hi> to be the dew of it, to make it as useful (and more) to the eyes of thousands, than I know it was to the ears of some who received these truths immediately from his mouth. I know many were awakened, and convinced, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by <hi>hearing,</hi> maist thou by <hi>reading.</hi> I

                  <hi>Chap. 4.</hi> The evil of quenching the Spirit, in respect of the <hi>Effects,</hi> whereof it is a <hi>Cause.</hi> The first effect of quenching the Spirit. <hi>It grieves the
<pb facs="tcp:100920:15"/> Spirit.</hi> Instances of it in the <hi>Old Worlds</hi> quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit, and in the <hi>Israelites</hi> quenching the Spirit. Not only the wicked, but the godly, do thus (sometimes) grieve the Spirit. That quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit grieves the Spirit, further proved. Arguments for the proof of it mentioned in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The Arguments applyed. The evil of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit in this respect. <hi>Ephes. 4.30.</hi> The evil of grieving the Spirit, from thence argued. The evil of quenching the spirit, thereby discovered. Those that quench the spirit, thereupon expostulated with, and rebuked.</item>

                  <hi>Chap. 5.</hi> The second effect of quenching the spirit. <hi>It gives advantage to corruption.</hi> Hence it is that corruption is so powerful and prevalent. There is nothing to hinder it, the spirit being quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence it is that it reigns still in some, and tyrannizeth in others. The evil of quenching the spirit, from hence argued. The Argument apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 6.</hi> The third effect of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>It gives advantage to Sathan.</hi> This shewed both in the general and in particular. <hi>Ephes. 2.2.</hi> Children of disobedience; who are they. The Devil works effectually in such, hath them in his power, takes them captive at his will. <hi>2 Tim. 2.26.</hi> Man by nature lower than Angels, by sin lower than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Leaving God his only Soveraign, is given up to the Devil, his greatest enemy. The Law ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:100920:15"/> to which he is thus given up to the Devil. Both soul and body, given to him as his house, and the powers and faculties of both, as his goods, to have, and use at his pleasure. <hi>Luk. 11.21, 24. Mat. 12.44.</hi> Explained. By quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Devil hath advantage to <hi>tempt.</hi> The day of <hi>Israels</hi> quenching the spirit. That day a day of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, not only in respect of God, but of themselves. The Devil was continually tempting them in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness. This applyed to those that quench the spirit. The reason why such are haunted with most abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and horrid temptations. Those that do not quench the spirit, may be tempted; but the Devil hath not such advantage to be tempting of them. The Devil is in a twofold chain, of Justice and Providence. Is restrained from tempting, when men quench not the spirit. By quenching the spirit, the Devil hath advantage to <hi>overcome.</hi> He blindes the Understanding. Perswades the Will. Fills the heart. Leads men up and down as they lead beasts. By quenching the spirit, he hath advantage to <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.</hi> None to answer his accusation, and plead their cause, that quench the spirit. Hereby he hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to <hi>afflict.</hi> To afflict men in their souls, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and estates. If Satan hath an advantage he will take it. The folly of those, that by quenching the spirit give him advantage. The misery of such. The tryumph of the dead over them.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 7.</hi> The fourth effect of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb facs="tcp:100920:16"/>
                  <hi>It gives advantage to the World.</hi> It gives advantage to the men of the world. It gives advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them to do wickedly themselves. They will do wickedly of themselves, much more, when they have advantage for so doing, given them by Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. Professors give them advantage so to do, by their quenching of the spirit. Then they do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to restrain them, but give way to them, and encourage them. Are either the occasions, or causes of their sinning. The occasions by their evil example; the causes, by their inticements and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, or by their commands and threatnings. The evil of quenching the Spirit in this respect, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Quenching of the Spirit gives advantage to the men of the world, to draw others to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with them. Hereby they have advantage to tempt, and to overcome by tempting. By this means, they have advantage to infect with wicked principles, and to seduce to wicked practises. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they have advantage to reproach and vilifie, and to oppress and persecute those whom they so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Quenching of the spirit gives advantage to the things of the world. The spirit being quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, men will be, and do any thing, though never so vile, for the getting and keeping of them. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and his instruments tempt efficiently; the things of the world objectively. God made man to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world; sin hath made the world to be above man. The world hath not only a tempting, but a
<pb facs="tcp:100920:16"/> prevailing and overpowering influence. Such an influence it hath over all the powers and faculties of the Soul, and over all the senses and members of the body. Hence men chuse sin rather than suffering, reject the Gospel, are man-pleasers, make shipwrack of faith, and a good conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Worldly lusts. Why so called. The prevalency of worldly lusts, is from quenching the spirit. The evil of quenching the spirit in this respect.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 8.</hi> The fifth effect of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>It brings into a Consumption.</hi> A threefold consumption that it brings men into, a consumption of Estate, Body, and Soul. Estates gotten and spent in a way of quenching the spirit, come to nothing. Life the most excellent thing in nature. Because of mens quenching the spirit, God destroyes it. Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diseases sent for this cause. Some Consumptive diseases come by sin, all come for sin. The consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul, the worst consumption. It is sent as the other two, for quenching of the spirit. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in two things, the wasting and pining away of gifts and common grace. Quenching the spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures it as the meritorious cause, provoking God to inflict it, and it works and effects it of it self. Some distinctions concerning this consumption. It is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partial or total, gradual, or at once. There is a consumption in this life, and in the life to come.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 9.</hi> The sixth effect of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>It hinders mens working.</hi> It hinders their
<pb facs="tcp:100920:17"/> working in their particular callings. When the spirit is quenched, men are either idle, and do nothing at all, or slothful, and do nothing to purpose. This a great sin. The <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it disorderly walking. It was one of <hi>Sodomes</hi> sins, for which it was destroyed. It hinders their working in their general calling. It hinders the working out of their salvation. It dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affects them, so that they will not work, if they could. When the spirit is quenched, affections are gone. Both affections of liking, in respect of what is good, and affections of disliking, in respect of what is evil. Affections being gone, there is no will. It disena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them, so that they cannot work if they would. <hi>Sampson</hi> thought he could have done as before, but the spirit being quenched, he could do nothing. The evil of quenching the spirit in this respect.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 10.</hi> The seventh effect of quenching the spirit; <hi>It hinders mens work.</hi> Sometimes even when the spirit is quenched, there may be <hi>working;</hi> but then quenching of the spirit hinders the <hi>work.</hi> It hinders the <hi>perfection</hi> of it. A twofold perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in opposition to that that is <hi>counterfeit,</hi> and that that is <hi>defective.</hi> Those that quench the spirit, can do nothing perfect, in opposition to that that is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit. They can do nothing truly or really good. A twofold goodness, <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward.</hi> Though they may do that that's <hi>outwardly</hi> good, yet they can do nothing that's <hi>inwardly</hi> so. They can do nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in opposition to that that is <hi>defective.</hi> There
<pb facs="tcp:100920:17"/> are many things lacking in all the duties they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. They work continually, yet do nothing. The evil of this in divers particulars. It hinders the <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it.</hi> God doth not accept of any thing, when the spirit is quenched. How to know when God doth not accept. If God doth not accept the <hi>work,</hi> he doth not accept the <hi>person.</hi> The evil of quenching the spirit in this respect.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 11.</hi> The eighth effect of quenching the spirit, <hi>It hinders mens suffering.</hi> This proved by that Exhortation of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, 2 Tim. 1.6, 7, 8.</hi> The Argument the Apostle there makes use of, declared. The inference from it, applyed. If the spirit be quenched, either men will suffer nothing at all, or nothing as they ought to do, when God calls them to it. They will not suffer from a right princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. When the spirit is quenched, there is no right principle. They cannot suffer in a right manner. There will be no perseverance in suffering to the end. The evil of quenching the spirit in this respect. An Objection answered. Not only nature, but grace too teacheth to avoid suffering, when God doth not call unto it. When God calls unto it, it is not from grace that men decline it. Two cases wherein God calls unto suffering, mentioned. When men cannot endure to suffer when God calls unto it, what it argues. What conclusions it occasions wicked men to make. What suffering men make themselves liable to, by avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suffering. The evil of suffering from a false
<pb facs="tcp:100920:18"/> principle. The evil of not suffering in a right manner. The evil of not persevering in suffering, and holding out to the end.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 12.</hi> The nineth effect of quenching the spirit, <hi>It hinders mens Communion;</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion they might otherwise have with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. When God knocks at the door, by the motions of his Spirit, if men would open to him, he would sup with them, and they should sup with him. When they will not open to him, the spirit withdraws. What communion with God is. What communion with God is had, when the spirit is not quenched. No Communion to be had, when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is quenched. No Communion then in <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi> None in comforts, and blessings which one enjoyes, none in afflictions and crosses which one suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. No communion then in <hi>Ordinances.</hi> The sweetest and fullest communion that Saints have on this side heaven, is that which they have in <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi> This lost by quenching of the spirit. Two sorts of persons that this speaks to. The sad condition of such, as by reason of their quenching of the spirit, never had communion with God to this day. The sad condition of such as have had it, but have lost it again, by their quenching of the spirit. To be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated from the Church, dreadful. To be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated from God, much more dreadful. When communion with God is lost, all is nothing that one
<pb facs="tcp:100920:18"/> enjoyes, though it be never so much.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> The tenth effect of quenching the spirit. <hi>It hinders mens Peace.</hi> It hinders mens peace with God. They are not at peace with him; he is not at peace with them. The evil of this. It is from quenching the spirit. Their Misery in this respect. It hinders Peace with themselves. The evil of this, and of quenching the spirit in this respect. This speaks to two sorts of persons. It hinders their peace with men. It hinders their peace with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 14.</hi> The eleventh effect of quenching the spirit, <hi>It hinders the efficacious working of the Ordinances.</hi> Ordinances are mighty through the spirit. They are weak through the flesh. They have no efficacy at all to do good, when the spirit is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but are effectual only to do hurt in that case. They are dead without the spirit, and leave men dead. A twofold death, in opposition to <hi>life,</hi> and to <hi>liveliness.</hi> Some dead, some dying under Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Some twice dead. How quenching of the spirit hinders the efficacy of Ordinances. It hinders what is necessary to be done on mans part, and what is necessary to bee done on Gods part, to make them effectual. The evil of this. The miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of such as quench the spirit in this respect. If Ordinances do no good, nothing will. If Ordinances bee not effectual to save, they will
<pb facs="tcp:100920:19"/> be effectual to damn. For Ordinances not to work effectually, a most dreadful Judgement. The more excellent the means, the more fearful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous their estate is, that do not profit by them.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 15.</hi> An Exhortation to those that have Quenched the Spirit to bewail it. What a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table evil Quenching of the Spirit is. How much evil it argues to be in us, how much evil to be upon us. It is our duty to lament for every sin, even the smallest, much more for this that is so great. We shall never be serious in setting our selves to the practise of the contrary duty of cherishing the Spirit, till we be humbled for our sin first in quenching the spirit. Either we shall not practise it at all, or not to the end. To grieve and mourn for Quenching the Spirit, a sign that it is not utterly quenched. What to be done that we may grieve and mourn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right for it.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 16.</hi> An Exhortation to those that have quenched the spirit, to beware of it. If there be cause to grieve that this sin hath been committed, there must needs be cause to fear lest it should be commited. If the effects of it be considered, we shall see how much hurt it doth; if the causes be considered, we shall see how much we are inclined to it. The more we are inclined to any thing that may be the cause of doing so much hurt, the more we should beware of it. Nothing, the not doing whereof may quench the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to be neglected. Nothing, the doing whereof
<pb facs="tcp:100920:19"/> may quench the spirit, to be done. The spirit not to be quenched in any degree.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 17.</hi> Men exhorted to beware of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spirit in themselves. Example not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in this case. It should make them the more to beware. Reasons why men should not quench the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in themselves. A threefold fire, the fire of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the fire of sin, and the fire of suffering. These fires may, and ought to be quenched, but not the fire of the spirit. If the fire of the spirit be utterly quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it can never be kindled again. Not by Saints. Not by Ordinances. What fire soever besides is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it will not avail. Such a fire shall be kindled, for the punishing of it, as shall never be quenched. If it be quenched but a little, there is danger, lest it should be utterly quenched.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 18.</hi> Men exhorted to beware of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spirit in others. It is possible they may quench the spirit in others, as well as in themselves. They are very prone to quench the spirit in others, as well as in themselves. Several cases wherein they are most prone to quench the spirit in others, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in particular. Though they do not eventually quench the spirit in any; yet if intentionally they do it, it is in the sight of God, as if they did it eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Though they do not intend it, yet if they do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, that in its own nature tends unto it, they are guilty as if they did intend it. The natural consequences of actions must be considered. There is
<pb facs="tcp:100920:20"/> the end of the Agent, and the end of the Action. A sinful action cannot be ordinated to any good end whatsoever. Men guilty of quenching the spirit, as well by not doing that which should be done, to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish and preserve it, as by doing that which puts it out. To quench the spirit in any one particular, in another, very sinful, though it be not utterly quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him. How many waies men quench the spirit in others. Arguments to disswade from it, and to perswade to beware of it.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Chap. 19.</hi> Men exhorted to beware that others do not quench the spirit in them. As there are many Incendiaries, to kindle the fire of the flesh; so, many extinguishers, to put out the fire of the spirit. Three sorts in this respect most dangerous; Carnal Friends, Wicked Adversaries, False Teachers. Arguments to perswade men to beware of them, that the spirit be not quenched by them. Directions to shew what is to be done, that the spirit may not bee quenched by them.</item>

                  <p>And to the first, What is meant by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? the answer is; That by the Spirit here is meant, the gifts and graces and good motions of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The gifts and graces of the Spirit. The gifts of the Spirit (called also common grace) such as <hi>Illumination, Conviction, tasting the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly gift,</hi> &amp;c. These are called the Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4. —<hi>were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. i. e.</hi> in respect of gifts and common Grace. The Graces of the Spirit, (called also <hi>special gifts,</hi> or <hi>grace</hi> by way of eminency) such as <hi>Faith, Hope, Love,</hi> and the rest of those fruits of the Spirit, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. These are called the Spirit, <hi>verse</hi> 17. <hi>The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh;</hi> i. e. corruption against grace, and grace against corruptio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Again, by the Spirit here is meant</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100920:21"/>2. The good Motions of the Spirit, inspired into the soul, and exciting and stirring up to good purposes and performances. As <hi>Judges</hi> 3.10. <hi>The spirit of the Lord came upon him,</hi> i. e. he was stirred up and moved by the Spirit, to do what he did; So <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.1. Christ was <hi>led by the spirit into the Wilderness,</hi> i. e. by the motion and impulsion of the Spirit. Both these are here meant by the Spirit, and are therefore called the Spirit, because they are the work and effect of the spirit in the soul, a manner of speaking ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent, wherein the effect bears the name of the cause. And thus you have the first parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, what is meant by the Spirit.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. 3.</head>
                  <p>The second is, what is meant by quenching the Spirit? For the clearing of which, you are to take notice, that the Spirit is here compared to Fire, so that considering what it is to quench the Fire, we may thereby understand what it is to quench the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take notice that the Spirit is here compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Fire. This is plainly implyed in the word <hi>Quench,</hi> which cannot properly be spoken (you know) of any thing but Fire, and therefore, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks here of Quenching the spirit, and nothing can properly bee said to be quenched but Fire, it is evident that the spirit is here compared to Fire. And it is compared to Fire.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100920:22"/>1. In respect of Illumination, or Inlightning. There is light in the Fire, and as the Fire doth inlighten, so doth the Spirit. By his gifts, and graces, and holy motions, he inlightens the soul. <hi>Inlightned and made partakers of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Heb. 6.4. So <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.17, 18. <hi>The Father of Glory give unto you the spirit of Wisdome, and Revelation in the knowledge of him, the eyes of your understandings being inlightned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In respect of calefaction, or heating. In Fire there is not onely light, but heat, and as the Fire doth heat, so doth the Spirit, <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us? Luke</hi> 24.32. how was that? why by the working of the spirit. As wicked men are said to <hi>burn in their Lusts, Rom.</hi> 1.27. and to be as <hi>hot as an Oven, Hos.</hi> 7.7. through the working of Satan, that <hi>Fiery Serpent</hi> or Dragon, that <hi>works effectually in them, Ephes.</hi> 2.2. so those that are Godly, may bee said to burn in their Graces, through the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy spirit in them. <hi>Be fervent</hi> (or hot) <hi>in spirit</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle) serving the Lord.</hi> i. e. in respect of the vigorous and lively actings of the graces of the spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In respect of Purification or cleansing. Fire hath a purifying vertue in it. (Purifying carries fire in its very name, the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> from whence it comes, signifying Fire.) So the spirit, it hath a purifying vertue in it, there is a purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100920:22"/> vertue in the gifts and graces, and good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the spirit, and therefore it is called <hi>a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Holiness, Rom.</hi> 1.4. in opposition to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness and uncleanness. Fire purifies by sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the dross, and consuming and burning off the rust; and so the spirit. Therefore <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.25. <hi>I will purely purge away thy dross, and take away all thy Tinne.</hi> i. e. by the working of the spirit. So <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, 2. he is <hi>like a refiners Fire, and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.</hi> This is spoken of <hi>Christ,</hi> who doth it by the operation of his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In respect of probation or tryal. Fire will try Metals, whether they be good or counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, so doth the spirit, and therefore is called <hi>the spirit of Revelation,</hi> and of this the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks when he saith, <hi>that every mans work shall be tryed by fire.</hi> 1 Cor. 3.13.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In respect of obsignation or sealing. Fire is made use of in sealing: So by the spirit Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are <hi>sealed to the day of Redemption, Ephes.</hi> 1.13. Fire melts the Wax that it may receive the impression of the seal, and the spirit melts the heart, that it may receive the impression of the Word.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In respect of Motion or Acting. Fire moves, 1. upwards. So those that are spiritual. Grace is of an ascending Nature. Oh! when the affections are kindled by this Fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100920:23"/> how do they mount up to Heaven? 2. With celerity and swiftness; so the Soul by spiritual ejaculations, darting up holy desires and requests.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In respect of vivification or quickning. Fire quickens and enliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns, so doth the spirit. <hi>The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.</hi> Rom. 8.2. <hi>The law of the spirit of life, hath made me free from the law of sin and death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In respect of consolation or comforting. Fire is comfortable both in respect of its light and heat; so the spirit administers comfort both these waies.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. In respect of penetration or piercing. Fire penetrates throughout all the pores and secret passages of the body that's thrown into it. So the spirit, it fills the whole soul, throughout all the powers and faculties of it. It's not only in the head, but in the heart, judgement, consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will, affections, all.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In respect of assimulation, or changing unto its own Nature. Fire turns all into fire. So the Spirit, <hi>That which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit,</hi> Joh. 3.6. It makes him that hath it to be spiritual, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. <hi>One spirit with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. And thus you see in what respects the Spirit is compared to Fire. Now</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for Quenching the Spirit; the word being a Metaphor taken from Fire, shews,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100920:23"/> that as Fire is quenched, so is the Spirit; so that by considering (as I have said) what 'tis to quench Fire, we may know what it is to quench the Spirit. Now to quench the Fire, is either somewhat to slake the heat of it, or else wholly to put it out: Though one doth not wholly put it out, yet if hee doth abate it, if hee doth any way diminish or lessen the burning of it, we say he quencheth the Fire; <hi>i. e.</hi> he quencheth it in some measure, and some degree; much more when it is wholly put out and extinguished. Two things then are here meant by quenching the Spirit,
<list>
                        <item>The <hi>abating,</hi> and</item>
                        <item>The <hi>abolishing</hi> of the Spirit.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>abating</hi> of the Spirit, the diminishing and lessening the gifts, and graces, and good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the spirit. When men lose some fruits and effects of the spirit; When by any miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, they cause the spirit to abate, of the life and vigour of his operations and motions in them, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> one should somewhat slake the heat, and lessen the burning of the Fire: When know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge decreaseth, and love decayes, and fruit withers: When convictions decay, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons die; then the spirit is quenched. And thus the godly quench the spirit; thus <hi>David</hi> quencht the spirit; thus the <hi>Angel</hi> of the Church of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> quencht the spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:100920:24"/>2. The <hi>abolishing</hi> of the Spirit. When men do not only diminish and lessen the gifts, and graces, and good motions of the spirit, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abolish them; so that there is not only a falling from former degrees of what they once had, but from the very truth and being of it. When men wholly lose the grace they once had, being <hi>twice dead, and pluckt up by the roots.</hi> Thus <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Apostates</hi> quench the spirit; thus <hi>Saul,</hi> thus <hi>Judas</hi> quencht the spirit; thus the five <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> quencht the spirit; <hi>Give us of your oyle</hi> (say they) <hi>for our lamps are gone out, Mat.</hi> 25.8. they had some fire and light, for a great while in their lamps, but at length the oyle was spent, and the fire went out. And thus it is with others, their counterfeit and common grace, after a while, after some time of glorious profession, comes to nothing; their oyle is spent, and their lamps go out in a snuffe. Thus you have the second Particular, what is meant here by quenching the Spirit, namely the abating and abolishing of it; both which are forbidden in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusively in this prohibition, <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>Now as for the third. How, or by what means the Spirit is thus quenched? To that I answer, That as fire, so the spirit is quenched these four waies.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:100920:24"/>
                     <item>1. By withholding of fewel.</item>
                     <item>2. By neglecting to stir and blow it up.</item>
                     <item>3. By withdrawing of fewel, and</item>
                     <item>4. By opposing something of a contrary quality to it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. Fire is quenched by withholding of fewel. When the fire is going out, and one saies, I will have no more Wood or Turf put in, carry it back again; by this means it slakes, and by little and little goes out. <hi>Where no Wood is, the fire goes out, Prov.</hi> 26.20. So the spirit comes to be quenched, when persons withhold those means that are appointed to be as fewel, for the feeding and preserving of it. Not using the means of keeping alive this fire of the spirit in us, is the first means of quenching it. When an indifferency of spirit grows, whether we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the means in publick or private or not; when you neglect Prayer, and Reading, and Hearing the Word Preached, and Meditating on what you have heard, your gifts and graces must needs languish and decay, the fire and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of your graces must needs be going out. Duties and Ordinances are the fewel of gifts, the fewel of grace, the fewel of good motions, if this fewel be withheld and kept back, so that you are not frequent and constant in applying it at every turn, as it were; by little and little the fire abates, and you are they that are guilty of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100920:25"/> quenching the spirit. If therefore you be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in your Consciences from the Word, that such and such means are necessary, and yet yee wil not use them, by your not using those means, you quench the spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Fire is quenched by neglecting to stir and blow it up. If the fire bee let alone and never stirred, it will go out of it self; though one cast in fewel, yet without stirring, and mending, and blowing, it will go out; the heaping on of few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in that case doth but choak it. And so the spirit is quenched, when you suffer your gifts and graces to lye idle, and do not keep them in continual use and exercise; when you do not stir up the gifts you have received, and improve your Talents. In this case, though there bee never so much means, never so many Sermons, and Sacraments, they do you no good, 'tis all one, as if there were none at all. The servant in the <hi>Parable</hi> had a Talent, but he wrapt it in a Napkin, and at last had it taken from him: So many they have a Talent of knowledge, a Talent of prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> i. e. they have a gift, but they do not improve it, and so it dwindles away and comes to nothing: Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothy, to stir up the gift he had received.</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> complains, <hi>that no man stirreth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Isa.</hi> 64.7. Though grace be an active princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it self, yet it is in our hearts, as fire is in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100920:25"/> green wood; fire is an active Element, but if it be in green wood, it will not burn without much blowing. So here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Fire is quenched by withdrawing of fewel; when one pulls away the wood, and scatters the coals asunder one from another, tis quickly slak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and at length goes quite out: so when you cast off the means which you formerly used, when you leave off the duties you have practised, and the ordinances you have attended, <hi>forsaking the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is, Heb.</hi> 10.25. every petty trifling bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness being a sufficient excuse to keep you away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. then you quench the spirit. Not only the not using, but the dis-using of the means, is a means of quenching the spirit: Yea, this is a far worse way of quenching the spirit, than the other. Some (happily through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) never made use of such and such means, others (being enlightned and convinced) have, but within a while cast them away; come to one Sermon, and then stay away two or three for it. Oh! reflect upon your selves, see what <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphaz</hi> laies to <hi>Job</hi>'s charge, <hi>Job</hi> 15.4. <hi>Thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</hi> q. d. Thou wert wont to worship God, to be much in meditation and prayer, and other holy duties, but now it is otherwise; <hi>thou castest eff fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</hi> This would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100920:26"/> have been a great evil in <hi>Job,</hi> had it been true, and a great evidence against him. But thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, they cast off Duties and Ordinances, and this is a with-drawing of fewel, the fewel of the Spirit, whereby the fire of the Spirit is quenched in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fire is quenched by opposing something of a contrary quality to it, as water, by pouring water upon it. Fire and water are contraries, by reason of their contrary qualities, so that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will not onely slake the fire, but put it quite out. And thus the spirit is quenched; sin and lust, and the acting of corruption in the heart and life, are unto the spirit, as water is to the fire; see <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>These are contrary the one to the other.</hi> The flesh is contrary to the spirit; and sin, the fulfilling of the lusts thereof, will quench it. This is true of all sin, but of some more especially; As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Plotted and premeditated sins, when men sin with a full purpose to do it, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the light and knowledge that comes in the way to hinder. When they do not slip, or fall into sin unawares, but wittingly and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run into the commission of it, even as <hi>the horse rusheth into the battel, Jer.</hi> 8.6. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> quench'd the spirit, he knew murder to be a hainous sin, yet did plot and contrive <hi>Uriah's</hi> death.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100920:26"/>2. Sins reiterated, and often committed. The frequent acting of sin is like a continual drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping upon the fire, though the drops bee but small, yet coming so many one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they hinder the fire from burning, and at length put it quite out. And thus it is also in quenching the spirit. When men trade in sin, <hi>to morrow shall be as to day, and the next like unto it,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks; though the sinnes be comparatively small, not so gross and hainous as others, yet by their frequency and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, being frequently acted over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they quench the spirit. <hi>Judah</hi> sins, but doth it no more, so <hi>David, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. but when sin runs in a Circle, and the sinner is endless in sinning, doth it again and again, at length he wearieth God, so that he saith, <hi>My spirit shall no longer strive with him, Gen.</hi> 6.3. Then hee <hi>gives him up to vile affections,</hi> and to a <hi>reprobate sense, Rom.</hi> 1.26, 28. Thus the spirit is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mens own sins, but not onely so, but by the sins of others. A man may put out the fire himself, and he may suffer it to be put out by others. They therefore that keep evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, wicked and ungodly society, do thereby quench the spirit. <hi>David</hi> therefore (when once hee was resolved to take a new course of life) sets up a resolution in his soul, to shake off the company of wicked men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.115. Hee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100920:27"/> knew he could not obey the motions of Gods Spirit else, in keeping his Commandements. Thus you see by what waies and means the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes to be quenched, which was the third particular to be shown.</p>

So <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Be watchful, and strengthen the things that remain, and are ready to dye:</hi> Noting that their graces were drawing to an end, even breathing out their last; and therefore if they did not bestir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to recover them, were like utterly to be lost. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Let him that thinketh
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100920:28"/> he standeth</hi> (i. e. that he shall stand) <hi>take heed lest he fall. Angels</hi> fell in heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Christs</hi> presence. To stand in grace, when there are so many potent enemies (so many corruptions and temptations) to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, is not so easie, and therefore hee admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth every one to look to his standing. To adde no more, <hi>Paul</hi> admonisheth <hi>Timothy, To stir up the gift that was in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. The word signifies stirring or blowing up the fire, <hi>q. d.</hi> keep blowing up this fire continually, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and cherish the fire of the spirit in thee, and by no means suffer it to be quenched; blow off the ashes, do not suffer it to go out, as it will, unless thou stir and blow it up. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>Now the reasons are from the necessity of having the spirit, and the danger of quenching it, which follows thereupon. It is necessary that we have the spirit in us, and therefore it must needs be dangerous to quench it. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is our life, the life of our souls; so much as we impair the graces of the spirit in us▪ so much wee impair the life of our souls. As the soul is to the body, so is grace to the soul, and the spirit to grace; the soul is the life of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and grace the life of the soul, and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the life of grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the graces of the spirit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100920:28"/> are they that do act the soul spiritually, that do give it spirituall sense and motion, do put spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life and motion into it, (without which it stirs not in any good duty, so as to do any thing that is good in the least) and the Spirit is that that puts life into Grace, and therefore the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and motions of the Spirit are necessary, and consequently it is dangerous to quench them. Those that are without the spirit, are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture said to be dead, <hi>dead in trespasses, and in sins.</hi> So it is said of those that have no other spirit, than that which works in the <hi>children of disobedience, Ephes.</hi> 2.1, 2. Those of the Church in <hi>Sardis,</hi> the spirit being quenched in them, though they had a <hi>name to live, yet were dead, Rev.</hi> 3.1. Those <hi>Widows,</hi> that <hi>lived in pleasure</hi> (being <hi>sensual, having not the spirit,</hi> as <hi>Jude verse</hi> 19.) were <hi>dead while they lived,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. So that the spirit, the graces and motions of the spirit, are the life of the soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as men are careful of the life of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, will take Physick, use good dyet, do any thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100920:29"/>2. When it is quenched (though but in some degree) it is not easily enkindled again. It cost <hi>David</hi> many a strong cry and groan, as you see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. and the <hi>Spouse</hi> many a weary step, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. Now if when the Spirit is quenched, it be so hard to bee enkindled again, there's reason that wee do not quench it, when it is well kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. When it is so hard to kindle a fire (as some fires are hard to be kindled, and will cost much) then men are more than ordinarily careful, not to let it go out.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If once it be utterly quenched, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be kindled again. The Scripture declares the condition of such as have utterly quench'd the Spirit, to be irrecoverable. So that if this fire bee once quite put out, it shall never bee lighted again more. It is true, there may be some great abatement, as in <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and yet it may be lighted again, as in them it was, (if there be but some few sparks, they may be blown up into a flame, <hi>Christ</hi> will not <hi>quench the smoaking Flax</hi>) but when it is utterly extinct, and quite abolished, it will never bee lighted again. See for this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4— 6. and <hi>chap</hi> 10.26. If the Tree be <hi>twice dead,</hi> then it is <hi>pluck'd up by the roots, Jude verse</hi> 12. Now it is far better never to have had the spirit at all, than to be in such a case, as <hi>Christ</hi> said of <hi>Judas,</hi> so may I say of such an one, <hi>better that man had
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100920:29"/> never been born.</hi> Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of such, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. <hi>For it had been better for them, not to have known the way of Righteousness, then after they have known it, to turn from the holy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement delivered unto them.</hi> Better thou hadst never had any convictions of conscience, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good motions of the Spirit within thee, then afterwards by neglecting, or disobeying them, to sin them quite away. It shall be easier for one of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> than for such an one as thou.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Every act of quenching the spirit, hath a tendency to the utter quenching of it, So that when a man is in a way of quenching the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he hath quenched it in some measure <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,</hi> so, if he do not desist, he may (for ought he knows) quench it utterly for the <hi>future.</hi> Nay, it is certain, if he do not desist, that he will; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. How dangerous is it therefore to quench the spirit, though but a little? This will be spoken to afterwards at large, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do but touch it here.</p>

                  <p>The Use then is in the first place for reproof. Is it so? Then it serves for the reproof of all those that do in any measure, quench the gifts and graces, and good motions of the Spirit in them. Oh! there be many such, who though they have not utterly <hi>abolished</hi> the spirit, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100920:30"/> fire is not put quite out, but there are some sparks still, yet they are very much guilty of <hi>abating</hi> it. Though there be some light, and some heat, yet nothing in respect, either of what hath been heretofore, or of what ought to be for the present; they have lost much, and regain little. Formerly they had high and rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apprehensions of the blessedness of the waies of God, of the glory and excellency of spiritual and heavenly things, but now it may bee said: <hi>Where is the blessedness yee spake of?</hi> Formerly there were frequent and powerful convictions, convictions from the Word, convictions from Afflictions, convictions from Mercies; convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sin, convictions of Duty; I but now scarce any thing, either of the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Works</hi> of God, either of <hi>Ordinances</hi> or <hi>Providences,</hi> makes any sensible impression upon their Spirits. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had lively and vigorous affections, Oh! what zeal, and fervencie of Spirit? what joy in hearing the Word? what melting affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions over sin? what delight in speaking of the things of God? what desire, yea, what long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after communion and holy fellowship with God, and the people of God? but now their love is grown cold, they have <hi>left their first love</hi> with <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and are become <hi>luke-warm</hi> with <hi>Laodicea,</hi> have no heart to any thing that's good. Formerly there was fruitfulness in every
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100920:30"/> good work, carefulness to take and improve all opportunities, but now they are empty and barren, like <hi>Ephraim, empty Vines,</hi> that <hi>bring forth fruit to themselves.</hi> Now where 'tis thus, is there not a manifest quenching of the spirit? If the fire be not quenched, it will not lessen, but encrease, and still grow greater, and greater; where then the fire does not onely not increase, but decay, there 'tis certainly quenched. And thus it is in many, I wish it bee not so in any of you, but if it be, then tremble and turn at the reproof that comes now to bee dispensed to you.</p>

It is not from any good in any respect, that men quench the spirit, but whatever it is from, it is evil, and only evil, and quenching the spirit is from it <hi>as it is evil,</hi> and therefore must needs be evil too. Now in speaking to this, I shall prosecute the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of quenching the fire, as in the former particulars.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100920:31"/> they have no minde in fire or any thing else, and so cannot bring any more fewel, cannot stir up the fire, nor blow it; and this must needs be a cause you know, that the fire goes out, because while they be in this condition, they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to keep it burning, so that, by that time they awake, there is not many times so much as a spark left, or if there bee, that is all, 'tis nothing so much as it was when they fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep. Why just so it is, when men quench the spirit, 'tis because they are spiritually asleep, and so have all their spiritual senses bound up, so that they are sensible of nothing for the time, that is of any spiritual concernment: they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear, nor see, nor feel: dream they may, but they apprehend nothing (nothing spiritual I mean) in its reallity. They see no danger for the present, fear none for the future, as having not their senses exercised to discern good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and while 'tis so, how is it possible they should take care of keeping the fire of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit burning in them? They cannot bring any fewel, they cannot stir up the fire, and so it must needs go out. Oh Sirs, if the spirit bee quenched in you, think with your selves whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee not because you are asleep. While <hi>Sampson</hi> slept, the spirit departed from him. While the <hi>foolish Virgins</hi> slept, their lamps went out; thence it was, that was the cause of it.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100920:32"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.8. There was some light before, some heat and warmeth when they fell asleep, but when they awoke, their lamps were gone out, the light, the heat, and warmeth was all gone. True, there was not oyle enough in their vessels, but had they been awake, they might have gotten oyle, they might have gone to them that sell; but then it was too late, the fire was gone out, and <hi>Christ</hi> would not stay, therefore 'twas too late to get oyle. This was the effect of their sleeping, and for this they are called foolish Virgins. Oh how many such foolish Virgins are there! that are asleep, that lye snorting in their carnal security, when they should be getting oyle into their vessels, to keep their lamps burning! If one would know the reason, why they neglect the means, and do not exercise themselves unto godliness, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; alas poor creatures, this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, they are in a deep sleep, and what would you have of them? they know nothing of it, and cannot help it. They think all is well, or if they dream otherwise, it is but a dream, and they sleep on still. One would wonder what is the matter with many Professors, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore were so zealous and active for God, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all opportunities, and improving all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for the service of God, but now are grown cold, and dead-hearted, having
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100920:32"/> no affection to any thing that is good, one would wonder, I say, what is the matter with such Professors, but if it bee considered, that they are asleep, the wonder will cease. If they were awake, it might be supposed, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer it to bee so; but being asleep, any thing may be any thing for them, they cannot help it. Heretofore being awakened by such a Sermon, such a sicknesse, as soon as ever they were awake, they began to bestir themselves, and oh! how zealous and active were they? how forward to every thing that is good? what ring-leaders in the waies of God? I remember the time, saith one, when such and such were the forwardest in all the Town, none were like unto them, so that they were ensamples unto all: I but now it is otherwise, they are fallen asleep, and have lost all sense of their condition; cry never so loud in their ears, nip them, pinch them, it doth not awaken them, they sleep now as the man <hi>upon the Mast in a storm,</hi> are secure under the <hi>thunder-clap,</hi> and hence it is that they do nothing. Now I beseech you, my beloved, reflect upon your selves, and consider. Is the Spirit quenched in you? and is it from hence that you are asleep? why consider then, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, is it not evil? Is it not evil that you should bee out of your senses? When a man is out of his senses, you count hee is in a miserable
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100920:33"/> condition, though it bee but his bodily senses. What a miserable condition are you in then, that are out of your spiritual senses? Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that you should bee like those <hi>Idols, Psal.</hi> 115.6. that have eyes, but see not, ears, but hear not, noses, but they smell not, hands, but they handle not, feet, but they walk not? Oh the miserable condition that your poor souls are in, that are thus asleep! Oh the dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wrath of God that is upon you! For the <hi>Lord hath poured out upon you, the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, Isa.</hi> 29.10. When <hi>Christ</hi> spake of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his being asleep, they said, <hi>Lord, if he be asleep, he shall do well, Joh.</hi> 11.12. but none can say so of you that sleep thus, no, you are not like to do well. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily sleep is sometimes necessary and refreshing, but spiritual sleep is alwaies dangerous, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deadly. The soul is still the worse for it, 'tis a spiritual <hi>Lethargy,</hi> 'tis a disease that tends to death; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 13.3. <hi>lighten mine eyes lest I sleep death.</hi> This makes persons neglect all. This hinders you from bringing in fewel, from stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up the fire, from guarding it from that of an opposite quality, and so is the cause of your quenching the spirit. When <hi>Sampson</hi> slept, the <hi>Philistins</hi> came and cut off his locks, hee could not defend himself from them, then the spirit departed from him. So you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the first particular.</p>

Men quench the spirit, because they are going to sleep; being drowsie, and having a minde to go to bed and sleep, they either put out the fire, or suffer it to go out of it self. So Professors, when they have a minde to sleep in their sins, and to take their rest there, then they quench the spirit; either put it out, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to go out of it self. This is the reason; It is because they are secure, and would willingly enjoy that quiet and content they finde for the present in their sinful way, and therefore either go to bed to sleep, or else being a bed, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slept already, but by some means or other are awakened, have a minde to sleep still, and therefore are angry with the means that awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, quarrel with reproofs and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, slight the good motions and convictions of the spirit, and so compose themselves to sleep again, saying as <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep.</hi> Thus the <hi>Spouse, Cant.</hi> 5.3. So you, beloved, it may be you are not asleep, but you are sleepy, a spirit of drowsiness and slumber hath seized upon you; you are willing to sleep, <hi>lying down, and loving to slumber, Isa.</hi> 56.10. Or it may be you have been asleep, and are now awakened again, but you are troubled that you are awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that you have lost your sweet sleep, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100920:34"/> therefore have a minde to sleep again, <hi>Yet a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more sleep,</hi> &amp;c. Well, sleep on, as <hi>Christ</hi> said <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.45. but know, that so shall thy <hi>poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man; Prov.</hi> 6.11. It's sad to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with sleep e're one is aware, but delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately to set ones self to sleep, and that after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral awakenings, Oh how vile is this! to set ones self to sleep, to put ones self into a sleepy positure? Farewel gifts, and grace, and spirit, and all, if you take this course. Oh! how canst thou sleep when thou hast so little Oyle in thy Vessel? and thy Lamp is ready to go out? <hi>What meanest thou O sleeper?</hi> said they to <hi>Jonah,</hi> and so say I to thee, thou drowsie Christian, What meanest thou? do'st mean to bee drowned? shall the light and life of the spirit be utterly extinguished in thee? Dost not see how the Waves and Billows begin to arise? How quickly will the waters over-flow thy soul, and quench the light of thy excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and glory of thy profession, unless thou speedily prevent it? See thy sin therefore, and be sensible of it. What doth this shew, but that thou takest pleasure and contentment in thy sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful condition? For wouldest thou bee willing to sleep in it else? and is that a condition for to sleep in? If thou wert troubled with a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, wouldest thou be willing to lye still, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100920:34"/> not to be awakened? or rather would'st not have some to stand by thee to keep thee awake? Why this is a spiritual Lethargy that is upon thee, and if thou sleepest, thou dyest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remedy. And therefore awake, awake, bring more fuel, stir up the Coals, blow up the Fire, by thy slumbering it is almost quite gone out. <hi>Be watchful therefore, and strengthen the things that remain and are ready to dye, Rev.</hi> 3.2.

                  <p n="1">1. In themselves, as when a man is in a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he cannot endure the fire, or any hot things. So professours when their light and knowledge, and convictions make them feaverish, then they take cooling things, then they endeavour to put them out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In others; Thus they dealt with <hi>John Baptist,</hi> because he was not onely a <hi>shining,</hi> but a <hi>burning light,</hi> thus with the <hi>Witnesses, Rev.</hi> 11. because they tormented them with the heat and fervour of their Doctrine. Now consider Sirs, whence is it that the fire of the Spirit should scorch? What doth this argue, that thou canst
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100920:35"/> not endure the heat and fervour of it, but it is still a vexation and torment to thee? Is it not onely to lust, that it is scorching? 'Tis scorching and painful indeed to Lust, but not to Grace. Oh if there were a gracious frame and temper of spirit in thee, the spirit of Grace would not bee too hot for thee. 'Tis a sign thou art too hot with lust and corruption. Sore flesh cannot abide the fire. But a gracious heart loves it, and takes great delight in it. <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us?</hi> (said they) <hi>q. d.</hi> Oh how good was it! Oh how comfortable! Saints never complain of extreams in grace and godliness; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain not they are too hot, but rather still they are too cold. But thou on the contrary art luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme, and lovest to be so. Thou wouldst be neither cold, nor hot; not so cold as to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and not so hot as to do much.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100920:35"/> when the <hi>means of Grace,</hi> the Fuel of the spirit grow chargeable to them. When pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession proves costly, and Religion must live upon them, and not they upon Religion; this makes many quench the spirit. As now you see men must pay for their Chimneys, this makes men damme up their Chimneys, and keep less fire. When men see they shall bee rated and taxed, and fined for their Religion, this makes them abate of their zeal and fervency of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and at length give it quite over. Thus the young-man, he came with hot affections, but when <hi>Christ</hi> told him he must sell all, how quickly were they quenched! <hi>He goes away sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,</hi> sorrowful that he could not be a Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at an easier rate, upon cheaper terms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was jocund and merry enough, when he could have his Religion and his estate too, but now he was sorrowful; sorrowful, though hee kept his Estate, because hee did not keep his Religion with it, and it may be Conscience told him, there would be a sad reckoning for it in the end, when, because he would not pay for his Religion, he should be made to pay for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.

Men quench the fire when it makes the pot boil over, and they are loath to lose any of the Liquor in it, then they run in haste, and pull away the fuel, or throw water upon the fire, that it may burn more soberly. So Professours when the fire of the spirit is like to boyle out somewhat of a beloved lust, a darling corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is very precious and dear unto them, then they bestir themselves in all haste to quench the fire, and cool the pot. Then throw away the fuel, there's too much praying, and too much preaching, too much adoe in matters of Religion, and less would serve by far, that so they may save their sweet lusts and corruptions. There is a <hi>filthiness,</hi> and <hi>superfluity of naughtiness</hi> in the heart of man, <hi>James</hi> 1.21. the <hi>scumme</hi> and <hi>excrement</hi> as it were of a filthy and corrupt heart and life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.6. which, before the fire of the spirit is kindled, is hardly discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, much less separable, it is so incorporated into mans nature; but when the fire of the spirit
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100920:36"/> comes, it makes it to boil up, so that it plainly appears upon the face of the soul; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God puts such efficacy into it, as to cause it to bee ready to boil over, the fire of conviction is so strong and vehement sometimes, as even to force out a beloved lust; but when it comes to this, Oh what bustling is there in a corrupt heart to quench the fire, that so the lust may be saved! How many carnal reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings blowing upon the pot to cool it? What with-drawing of the fire from the pot, or the pot from the fire? with-drawing of duties and Ordinances from ones self, or ones self from Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Ordinances, so that the scum goes not out, but sticks to the pot, and is boiled in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Now that you may see what a vile thing this is, to quench the fire of the spirit, rather than the scum and filthiness of sin should bee boiled out by it; See how God threatens it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.6. <hi>Woe to the pot, whose scum is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and whose scum is not gone out of it, therefore</hi> saith God, verse 11. <hi>set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brasse of it may be hot and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed. She hath wearied her self with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall bee in the fire.</hi> And see the next verse, where God sets down the cause, <hi>In thy filthiness is lewdness, i. e.</hi> obstinacy hath
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100920:37"/> been the onely cause that thou hast not been cleansed, thou wilt not be cleansed. I have kindl'd a fire that would do it, but thou opposeth the work of the fire, because thou wilt not be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and therefore <hi>in thy filthiness is lewdnesse,</hi> thou art come to an height, an excess of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. Now see what God threatens for this, <hi>Because I have purged thee,</hi> (i. e. endeavoured, used means to purge thee) <hi>and thou wast not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee,</hi> which is the most dreadful Threatning in the Book of God. Oh think of this, you whose corruptions are the more exasperated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, the more light and conviction you have, even so enraged, as that when it comes to the point of purging out such a sin, and utter aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning of it, then you endeavour by some means or other to put out the light, and slake the heat of your convictions, that so you may return to your former temper and course again.</p>

Oh! if we did but consider it, we should be afraid of such fear, such fear as makes one afraid of doing his Duty, and not afraid of sinning against God; as if man could be more terrible than God, as if man whose breath is in his nostrils, could do us more hurt than the Almighty God. And as for the shame, is it not a most shameful shame? for it makes one ashamed of his glory, and to glory in his shame, as if it were a shame to bee reproached for doing his Duty, and no shame to Apostatize from it.

And so Professors, when there is no more work to be done by the spirit, then they quench it.

But when the danger, the sickness, the conviction is over, then they neglect the spirit, because now they think they have no use of it. As when men are sick, they make use of Physick, but when they are well again, they think they do not need it. When men have no use of fire, they let it go out, and so when men have no use of the spirit, when there is no more grace to be gotten, no more corruption to bee mortified, no more Temptation to be resisted, no more burden to bee born, no more work to be done for the working but of their salvation, but they can go on end-waies in a formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, without any difficulty; then they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the spirit, then they disobey it, and quench it, slighting good motions, neglecting the means and exercise of Grace, not stirring up the gift they have received, because they can do well enough without it, there's nothing more to be done by it. Now consider Sirs; consider I beseech you, what a strange thing this is. What! nothing to be done by the spirit? why there's nothing can be done without the spirit. Oh how is it, thou should'st see no use of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when as thou hast use of it for every thing▪ All the good the Saints have, they have it from the spirit, and all the good the Saints do, they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100920:42"/> do it by the spirit; there's never a Grace they exercise, but it is a fruit of the spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. never a corruption they mortifie, but it is by the spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. Grace is a necessary good (as I have sometimes shewn you) necessary for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very duty, against every sin, every temptation, every affliction; and the motions of the spirit are necessary for the acting of Grace. <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord.</hi> What, doth this argue therefore that thou should'st have no more work to be done by the spirit, but either the bruitish folly and ignorance, or gross stupidity and fortishness of thy heart? Why consider, what canst thou do without the spirit? canst thou believe? canst thou repent? canst thou deny thy self without the spirit? canst thou mortifie any lust? canst thou exercise any grace? canst thou think any good thought without the spirit? nay further, canst thou perform any duty? canst thou pray? canst thou hear? canst thou meditate? canst thou do any of these without the spirit? or if thou canst, yet consider, canst thou do them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably without the spirit? Will God, that is a Spirit, and requires to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, be satisfied with the flesh instead of the spirit? will God accept of spiritless pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? will God accept of spiritless hearing? spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritless performing of spiritual duties? nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100920:42"/> yet, consider, will God accept of thy buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, selling, building, planting without the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? is not the plowing of the wicked sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause without the spirit? Now if thou canst not do these without the spirit, how canst thou do the other? if thou canst not buy and sell, how canst thou pray without the spirit? if thou canst not do any thing of thy particular calling with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirit, how canst thou do any thing of thy general? Again, was something to be done by the spirit in time of danger, and is there not as much to bee done by it in time of safety? hadst thou work for the spirit in time of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and hast thou none in time of health? Could'st thou not make thy peace without the spirit, and dost think thou canst keep it without the spirit? could'st not tell how to want with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the spirit, and canst thou tell how to abound without it? could'st not tell how to bee sick without the spirit, and canst thou tell how to be well without it? and for this reason, wilt thou neglect, wilt thou slight, and quench the spirit? Is it not as hard to exercise grace in one condition as in another? in time of peace as well as in time of trouble and danger? in health, as well as in sickness? in abundance, as well as in want? See thy folly therefore, see what a stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid sottish heart thou hast, in that thou quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the spirit, as having no more work to bee done by it.</p>

And so thou, if this fire of the Spirit come down at any time into thy heart, God requires thou shouldest bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually watching and attending it, that so it may never go out again, but be a fire burning there to all eternity. But Oh! how often dost thou forget? and this forgetfulness is out of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; thou remembrest the things of the flesh, and the things of the world, and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gettest the things of the Spirit: While thou art careful and troubled about <hi>the many things</hi> with <hi>Martha,</hi> thou forgettest to take care of <hi>the one thing necessary</hi> with <hi>Mary.</hi> How often is the fire of the Spirit quenched in thee e're thou art a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware? e're thou canst bethink thy self, or recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect thy thoughts, they being so intent upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in the mean while?

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100920:44"/> this argue, but that thou dost not prize it as thou shouldest? if thou didst, thou couldst not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, at least so frequently and ordinarily as thou doest. <hi>Can a Maid forget her Ornaments?</hi> saith God, <hi>yet my People have forgotten mee, days without number,</hi> Jer. 2.32. <hi>q. d.</hi> If I were but so much to you, as toys and trifles are to a Maid, you would not forget me, and yet you forget me ordinarily, days without number. A godly man may sometimes forget, (though that is no part of his godliness) but you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten me daies without number. Oh consider Back-slider, consider, canst thou tell the hours, the dayes, the weeks, not to say the years, that thou hast been unmindful of the Spirit? Oh 'tis time out of minde that thou hast forgotten the Spirit, that thou hast neglected the keeping of thy heart, the searching and trying of thy ways, the casting up of thy accounts; whereas here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, not a day could passe without minding these, and minding them as thy main business. And what hast thou been minding all this while, but vanities, and trifles, things not worthy of so much as a serious affectionate thought, much less of so many as thou hast spent upon them, and that infinitely without number. See thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness therefore in that from hence it is, that thou hast quench'd the Spirit.</p>

                  <p>Well then, see my Beloved, what an evil thing this is, that you grieve the Spirit. Do you know what you do <hi>Sirs,</hi> when you grieve the Spirit? do you know? do you consider? do you consider who it is that you grieve? Is it not the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit of God? the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption? <hi>Oh grieve not the holy Spirit of God</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle) whereby you are sealed unto the day of Redemption,</hi> Ephes. 4.30. <hi>First</hi> I say, Is it not the Spirit of God? And how is it that thou wilt grieve the spirit of God? Is it in some case evil to grieve the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a man, the spirit but of a Creature? and is it not much more evil, in any case, to grieve the spirit of God? Why, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> said to <hi>Ananias, thou hast not lyed unto men, but unto God:</hi> So may I say unto thee, <hi>Thou hast not grieved men, but God</hi> What an horrible thing is this? Oh you should <hi>walk worthy of the Lord to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100920:52"/> all well-pleasing, Col.</hi> 1.10. Whereas by quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spirit in this manner, thou walkest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him, to no pleasing at all. While it is thus, thy waies are <hi>alwaies grievous:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be grievous to men, or no, that's not so much the question: but how-ever, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are alwaies (in this case) grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. <hi>Again,</hi> Is it not the holy spirit of God? Oh grieve not the holy spirit of God. Because he is so holy, therefore by quenching the spirit, thy neglecting the graces, slighting the motions and rebelling against the strivings of the spirit, are so grievous to him, therefore he is so apt to be grieved at it. Now this is a great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy wickedness, as if it were but a holy man, it were a great matter, as it was a great aggravation of the wickedness of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> that they <hi>vexed</hi> Lot's <hi>righteous soul,</hi> by their filthy deeds; but how much more is it to grieve, nay vex, nay, to do despight to the spirit of grace. <hi>Moreover,</hi> is it not the Holy spirit of God, <hi>whereby you are sealed to the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> i. e. whereby you are, or may be, and must be; if ever you bee sealed? And do yee thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? What doth this shew, but that thou hast but little esteem of the spirit, and of the love of the spirit? Oh if it be but a man whom you love and esteem, you say: I would not grieve
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100920:52"/> him for a world; but thou grievest the Spirit for a straw, for a very trifle.</p>

What is the reason, I say, that thou art ever and anon almost, followed with tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to these, and such like things?

He follows thee whitherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou goest; when thou goest to the shop, he is with thee, when thou goest to the market, he is with thee; he follows thee to Sermons, and follows thee to Sacraments; hee follows thee where-ever thou goest.

                  <p>It is true indeed the Devil will tempt when the Spirit is not quenched, but not so much. Even the most holy, and those that walk most exactly may be tempted, as <hi>Christ</hi> himself was; but the Devil has not such an advantage, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath not such encouragement to be tempting of them, as he hath to be tempting of others, because he hath not such hope to prevail; their strictnesse, and precisenesse, and circumspect walking, their keeping their hearts with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, their walking after the Spirit, and not after the flesh, is a discouragement to him; and besides, (which is a principal thing to be taken notice of as to this) he hath not that liberty: God keeps him off, and will not suffer him to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100920:61"/> meddle with them, according to his promise; <hi>Resist the Devil, and he shall fly from you, James</hi> 4.7. therefore he is not so busie about such, ordinarily as about others. <hi>Luther</hi> could say, he did not know that he was tempted to cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse; and so many of the Saints of God can say, 'tis seldom or never that they are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to several things, that others are tempted to almost continually. And this is the fruit of their walking in the spirit, and living in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Grace. And therefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> saies, <hi>Watch and Pray, least ye enter into Temptation: q. d.</hi> So long as you be watchful, and observant of the motions of the spirit, so far from quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that you pray for the continuance of them; so long you are like to be the more safe: but if you grow carelesse and remisse, you will enter into Temptation presently. If the Devil once see you begin to slight and neglect your waies, he will set upon you with a Temptation immediately; he is forward enough of his own accord, and God will let him loose upon you. He is as a fierce Mastiffe or Lyon, bound up with a Chain: God hath him in a Chain of Justice, and a Chain of Providence, and so long as a man keeps close to God, prizing and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and following the good motions of the spirit, so long ordinarily, God holds in Satan, and will not suffer him to meddle at all with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100920:61"/> him. <hi>Because thou hast kept the word of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, I also will keep thee from the hour of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Rev.</hi> 3.10. But when once the Spirit is quenched, when a man neglects, or rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit, then God lets Satan loose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.

Oh! it is a special advantage, for if he get liberty to tempt, 'tis a thousand to one, but hee prevails by temptation. You heard before, that quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit gives great advantage to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: And now further, you hear that it gives great advantage also to temptation. Now when Corruption and Temptation meet, (as one said you know) they are like to make sad work. Therefore, as 'tis a great mercy to bee kept from Temptation, I mean, from being Tempted at any time, so especially at such a time, when our Corruptions are stirring; because if Temptation should bee stirring too, at the same time, when the heart is so distempered with Corruption, there must needs be a closing with it. Therefore <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>Watch and Pray, least ye enter into Temptation.</hi> Wee should bee
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100920:62"/> careful of that, because when we are tempted, it is so difficult a thing not to be overcome by the Temptation.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Hereby he hath advantage to accuse. Hee Tempts men, and women, leads them up and down to commit sin, and what's their reward? Why, as soon as they have sinned, he comes and accuseth them before God, and pleadeth against them for their condemnation. It may be, Conscience doth not accuse thee to thy self, nor men to God; but Satan doth. Such an one hath quenched the Spirit; "I'le do his errand for him (saies the Devil.) Away he goes, and tells God what a wretch thou art. <q>Lord saith he, dost thou not see such an one, how he slights the motions of the Spirit, casts the word behinde his back? But I do no sooner come, but he obeys presently; I do no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er say to him, go, but he goes, and come, but he comes; I got him along with me such a day, to the Ale-house, and when hee was there, he could not be got out again till he was drunk; I tempted him another day to uncleannesse, and how did he spend his time in Chambering and Wantonness? Lord,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100920:65"/> dost thou not see what an Hypocrite he is? professeth himself to bee a Christian, but lives like an Infidel; has taken up a form of godliness, but denyes the power thereof.</q> Oh how do the men of the world cry out upon him, for his idleness, and sloathfulness, and falseness, for his wantonness, and drunkenness? He makes Conscience he pretends, of Service and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but no Conscience of sitting with vain persons, and going in with dissemblers, of tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the Ale-bench, and being drunk with the drunken. Hee was zealous, and earnest at first, to become a Church-member, but now he does not value his Church-membership at all, I have kept him from the Assemblies, from Sermons, and Ordinances time after time, and if it were not for very shame, he would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn an Apostate. Thus the Devil accuseth thee, when at any time thou quenchest the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He is called the Accuser of the Brethren. Now if he did falsly accuse thee, it were no matter; but when thou quenchest the Spirit, he doth justly accuse, and God must needs bee much incensed thereby. As when he hears the cries of the oppressed, it may be, those that cry, are as wicked as their Oppressours, yet their cries do move God against them. When the Devil accused <hi>Job,</hi> God saies, he moved him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him without cause; but when he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100920:65"/> thee when thou quenchest the Spirit, is there not a cause? and will hee not be like to carry it against thee, when thy quenching the Spirit is so frequent and common, against light and knowledge, and convictions, and manifold strivings of the Spirit to the contrary? This is a fearful Judgement; <hi>Set thou a wicked man over him,</hi> and let Satan stand at his right hand, was the <hi>Psalmists</hi> direful imprecation upon <hi>Judas, Psal.</hi> 109.6. <hi>Let Satan stand at his right-hand;</hi> what to do? Why, to accuse him. Now if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan accuse, and thou hast none to answer to his accusation, none to plead thy cause, must it not needs go against thee? thou canst not plead for thy self, thy own Conscience condemns thee; and dost think <hi>Christ</hi> will? Yes, if thou didst humble thy self, and yeild thy self to bee under the government of his Spirit; but if thou continuest thus to quench his Spirit, he will not speak a word for thee. <hi>Father, I pray not for the World,</hi> saith he, <hi>John</hi> 17.9. I pray not for these worldly, earthy, sensual professours; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan accuseth them, and I have nothing to say for them. I have stroven with them again and again by my Spirit, but still in vain, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Satan will have them, let him have them; This is the third advantage Satan hath by quenching of the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> To accuse.</p>

The Devil hath a great hand in the afflictions that come upon men; and though sometimes it is for trial, as when God permitted him to afflict <hi>Job;</hi> yet ordinarily, it is for punishment of sin, especially, this of quenching the Spirit: This gives him advantage to afflict men,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In their souls. Before they have sinned, he comes as an Angel of light, <q>Why dost thou scruple? saith he, why art thou afraid? why, either 'tis no sin, but thy Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; what? is it not lawful to drink now and then with good company? or, what-ever the company be? is it not lawful, now and then to play a game or two for ones recreation? therefore, why art thou afraid? dost not know thy liberty? Or if it be a sin, yet thou canst repent, and then God will be merciful.</q> I but when once thou hast yeilded, then hee changeth his tone. <q>Oh what hast thou done? saith hee, hast thou indeed quench'd the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? and that by sinning against light, and profession? and by falling into a gross sin, that seldome any truely regenerate fall into? Why then, there is no hope; thou art a very Hypocrite.</q> What's the reason you are so full of doubts, and fears, and jealousies, and do so often sweat such cold sweats in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100920:66"/> Oh! is it not from hence? Is not the hand of <hi>Joab</hi> in this? and why so, but because you quench the spirit? When <hi>Saul</hi> quenched the Spirit, an evil Spirit from the Lord trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him. When the incestuous person quencht the Spirit, then Satan was ready to terrifie, and afflict his Conscience, and therefore the Apostle gives that advice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7,—11. Thus you see, hereby Satan has advantage of troubling men in their mindes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In their bodies. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. hence hee is said to have the <hi>power of Death,</hi> Heb. 2.14.</p>

                  <p>The fourth Effect of Quenching the Spirit, <hi>It gives advantage to the World.</hi> It gives ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the men of the World. It gives ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them to do wickedly themselves. They will do wickedly of themselves, much more, when they have advantage for so doing, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by Professors. Professors give them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage so to do by their quenching of the Spirit. Then they do not endeavour to restrain them, but give way to them, and encourage them. Are either the occasions, or causes of their sinning. The occasions by their evil example: the causes by their inticements, and allurements, or by their commands and threatnings. The evil of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit in this respect discovered. Quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit gives advantage to the men of the world, to draw others to do wickedly with them. Hereby they have advantage to tempt, and to overcome by tempting. By this means, they have advantage to infect with wicked principles, and to seduce to wicked practices. Hereupon they have advantage to reproach and vilifie, and to oppress and persecute those whom they so seduce. Quenching of the Spirit, gives advantage to the things of the World. The Spirit being quenched, men will be, and do any thing, though never so
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100920:68"/> vile, for the getting and keeping of them. Satan and his instruments, tempt efficiently; the things of the world objectively. God made man to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the world; sin hath made the world to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove man. The world hath not onely a tempting, but a prevailing and overpowring influence. Such an influence it hath over all the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the soul, and over all the senses and members of the body. Hence men chuse sin, rather than suffering, reject the Gospel, are man-pleasers, make shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Worldly Lusts. Why so called. The prevalency of worldly lusts is from quenching the Spirit. The evil of quenching the Spirit in this respect.</p>

When Professors shall either not do, what should be done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain them, or do, what should not be done, to give way to them and incourage them: when they shall either omit, or commit that which proves either an occasion, or a cause of their doing evil; an occasion, as when they give an evil example; a cause, as when they sollicit, and tempt them to do wickedly; when it is thus, that professors carry themselves in this manner: carnal people, the men of the world, have a great advantage to sin. When they can sin without controul; and not onely so, but (for ought they see) even with the good liking, and approbation of those that should check, and restrain them; this must needs encourage them to run to all excess of Riot, and embolden them to commit all iniquity with greediness. Now by quenching the spirit you give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them (to sin in this manner) both these waies.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. You do not that that should be done to restrain them. When the Spirit is quenched in you, so that you are not spiritual your selves, then you take no care that others should bee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100920:69"/> spiritual: When you neglect your own waies, you do much more neglect the waies of others. Unless it be out of Hypocrisie that you minde them (as indeed the Hypocrite makes himself the keeper of other mens Vineyards, though he neglect his own; quarrels with the mote in anothers eye, though he be not troubled at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

When a man hath no regard to himself; what he himself doth, he hath as little regard to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers what they do. Oh! what advantage have a luke-warm, formal, and profane people, under a luke-warme, formal, and profane Minister! What advantage have wicked Servants, under a cold, and dead-hearted, sottish, drunken Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? What advantage have froward and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Children, under a fond and foolish Parent? If the Minister neglect the Word, so will the People; if he have quenched the Spirit, so that he is neither cold nor hot, but a midling Preacher, hovering over mens heads in some general things, but never comes home to the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100920:70"/> Conscience, to the particular case and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his hearers, then they may be and do any thing notwithstanding his Ministry; the Drunkard is secure, the Adulterer is secure, the Proud, the covetous Worldling, the Scorner and Scoffer at the Waies and People of God; the Formalist, the meer Civillist yea, the veriest ignorant and profane wretch that is; they are all secure, and hope to go to Heaven as well as the best, under such a Ministry. So Children and Servants, if the Father and Master have quencht the Spirit, so that he is Earthly and sensual, minding onely the things of the world, or the things of the flesh; but as for reading, praying, singing, repetition of Sermons in the Family; he either altogether, or frequently o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them; or doth but carelesly and formally perform them: then they may be any thing in the family; then they have advantage of living as they list, of satisfying their lusts to the full in such a family. If they be ignorant, they may be ignorant still; if loose and profane, they may be loose and profane still; if in an unregenerate state, having not closed with Christ, they may be there still for any thing that he doth to bring them out of it, never dealing with them perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally concerning their spiritual condition, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to make them sensible of their lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without <hi>Christ,</hi> and shewing them the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100920:70"/> way of recovery and salvation by him: Thus you see, if you have quenched the Spirit, then you give great advantage to those of the world to do wickedly, as not doing that which should bee done to restrain, and to reclaim them.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The occasions by your evil Example. When the spirit is quenched, there can bee no good example ordinarily. Indeed, an Hypocrite may act a part for a time, and make a fair shew in the flesh; the fire of gifts, and common grace in him, being not quenched, may clarifie and brighten his outward Conversation; but when this fire of common grace begins to be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within, there will some darkness and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness appear without, much more when the fire of special grace is in any measure extinguished, and the motions of the Spirit neglected; then you will grow light, and lose, and vain, and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and unsavoury in your words, and actions: and this will be an occasion of sinning unto those with whom you converse, and to those that are under your charge; When they see you do so, and so; Why may not wee (say they do
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100920:71"/> so too? they think they may do the very same, though perhaps it go somewhat against Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>If any man see thee which hast knowledge, sit at meat in the Idols Temple</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle) shall not the Conscience of him that is weak be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldned to eat those things which are offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10. Thus they think they may do the very same. And if they happen to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some gross sin, then they think you do as bad in another kinde, and so you are a comfort to them, as 'tis said <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was unto them of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Ezek. 16.54. <hi>That thou maist bear thine own shame, and maist bee confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort to them. Jerusalem</hi>'s sins justified <hi>Samaria</hi>'s; when people see others exceed them in sinning, this (their own sins hereupon seeming to be less) makes them frame a kinde of comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which proves an occasion to them of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning still, more and more. Thus you are the occasions by your example.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The causes by your inticements and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by your commands and threatnings. When the spirit is quenched, then you do not onely do wickedly your selves, but endeavour to draw on others; either corrupting them by flatteries and fair speeches, or else compelling them by your frowns and threatnings, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if they be such as are under your charge; If
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:100920:71"/> a Magistrate have quench'd the Spirit, then he doth not onely practice evil himself, but require it (sometimes) to bee practised by others; So Masters, so Parents. And as for others, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ough they cannot command, yet they will argue and perswade. When you have quench'd the spirit in your selves, then you do not effect it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; When the motions and actings of sin and corruption are pleasing in your selves, then they are pleasing in others also, then (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing you know the Judgement of God, that they that commit such things are worthy of death) yet you not onely <hi>do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them;</hi> As they, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. Thus you give advantage to the wicked when you quench the Spirit, so that they may be, and do any thing, even what they please for you; Live in a state of sin, and walk in a way of sin, and thou dost nothing to bring them out of it; nay, much perhaps to further them in it.</p>

O there is a kinde of majesty in holiness; If you did but keep this fire of the spirit burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then you would either win upon wicked men, or wound them; you would either draw
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100920:73"/> them, or daunt them; So that they should not dare to be so vile in your presence, in your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as else-where. While <hi>Joash</hi> lived with <hi>Jehojada,</hi> he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, all his daies, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.2. So while you were spiritual, and zealous, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, those that were with you did that which was right, they durst not do otherwise in your company, in your Families: and whence was this, but from your care not to quench the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? I, but now 'tis otherwise, thou art grown carnal, and worldly, and vain, and sottish, and so all sorts have an advantage to do wickedly, and thou dost nothing to reform it.</p>

                  <p>Now see what a vile thing this is, that any should have such an advantage to sin, through thy quenching of the spirit. Shouldst thou not do what in thee lies to save souls, and dost thou not care that they be damned? <hi>Through thy knowledge</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>shall the weak Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perish, for whom Christ dyed?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. So say I, through thy quenching of the spirit, shall the weak, the ignorant, carnal brother, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, wife, childe, servant, dye for whom <hi>Christ</hi> dyed? Is it not enough that thou wilt damn thy self, but thou wilt also damn others too? Art thou worse than the very damned in Hell? why such a disposition is hardly to be
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100920:73"/> found in Hell. The <hi>Rich-man</hi> would have had one sent to warn his Brethren, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is it not enough that thou wilt do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy self, but thou wilt have others do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly too? Is it not evil that thou dost not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sin, but wilt thou needs further it too? Art thou not then a most vile wretch? Art thou not a very wicked person? is not he a wicked Magistrate, is not he a wicked Minister, that will give the people advantage to do wickedly? And art not thou a wicked Father, a wicked Master, a wicked Professor, that wilt give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to thy Children, Servants, Brethren, to do wickedly? Oh consider, shouldst thou not hinder them all that thou canst? shouldst thou not restrain those under thy power? Hath God charged the Minister with the People, and hath he not charged the Master with the Servants? the Father with the Children? and the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the rest of his Brethren? Wilt thou then say with <hi>Cain, Am I my Brothers Keeper?</hi> will God endure this in thee? will he bear it at thy hands? O saith he of <hi>Abraham, I know</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>that he will command his servants,</hi> &amp;c. but what will he say of thee? why, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I know such an one, that he will let them alone, never instruct them, never pray with them, or for them, never Catechize them, never reprove them, never do any thing that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100920:74"/> tends to their spiritual good, their edification, and salvation. And will not God punish for this? See how he threatens <hi>Eli, because his sons made themselves vile</hi> (saith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e) <hi>and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained them not,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.13. See what God saith to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> Ezek. 3.17, 18. <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watch-man, &amp;c.</hi> so in like manner, God saith to thee. He hath made thee a Watch-man in the family, a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Church, a Watch-man in the Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> see the command, <hi>Jude</hi> 22.23. <hi>Others save with fear &amp;c.</hi> but thou hast lost all fear, having quench'd the spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> the spirit of fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so dost not, canst not save, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy. Oh consider the cry of the blood of souls, think upon the crie of soul-murther. Thou abhorrest the murthering of bodies, but how is it that thou murtherest souls? Why this is the effect of thy quenching the spirit. Thou givest men advantage of murdering themselves, because thou givest them advantage of doing wickedly. Thus you see the first particular, It gives advantage to the men of the world to do wickedly themselves.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Hereby they have advantage to tempt you. They would not be so ready to tempt, but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100920:74"/> that they see the spirit quenched in you. How seldome is it, that a chaste Woman is meddled with, till she begin to grow light and wanton, and proclaims by her attyre, and carriage, and behaviour, what will please her? so how sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome it is that a Professor is meddled with, while he is stedfast in his practices, according to his principles? but when he begins a little to yeild, then the adversaries try to win him. When a mans spirit fails, every one will set upon him. What's the reason thou art so continually haunted, and followed up and down by evil company? Why do they so hang after thee, and delight to be in thy company? Oh consider, is it not because the spirit is quenched? because they see thou art not so zealous, and fervent, as sometimes thou seemedst to bee? Oh if thou weart spiritual and serious, they would not care for thee, they would not come near thee. Did <hi>Ahab</hi> care for <hi>Michaiah?</hi> would he have sent for him, had not <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> urged him? Why no more would they care for thee, or send for thee, weart thou such an one as he was. But thou art yeelding, and plyable, and therefore it is that they follow thee. Would the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ever speak unto thee (as he doth) the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, to go with him to the Ale-house, to the Play-house, hadst thou denyed the first? Would hee ever trie to make thee drunk, if
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100920:75"/> hee had not seen that thou lovest drink.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby they have advantage to overcome you. Oh if you did not quench the spirit, they could not overcome you, but you would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them, see for this, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5. But the spirit being quenched, they have the odds, they have the advantage.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To infect you with wicked principles. Of whom hath the man of sin the advantage, to make them believe a lie, but of such as quench the spirit? see 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To seduce you to wicked practices. Who are they that have their conversations according to the course of this world, but the children of disobedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> those that quench the spirit? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.2. Hence it is that you live to the lusts of men, and do the will of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2.3. Oh consider, what is the reason that thou art afraid of man, that thou hankerest after strange Lovers, that they can make thee do any thing, that thou bowest down thy soul to those that say, bow down that wee may go over. Now see what a vile thing this is. <hi>The time past may suffice,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> What? will ye begin again? <hi>If I yet pleased men,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> then, notwithstanding mine <hi>Apostleship,</hi> notwithstanding all my Preaching, <hi>&amp;c. I were not, I could not bee the servant of Christ.</hi> Oh what a vile thing is this? shall these <hi>Philistims,</hi>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:100920:75"/> defie the Host of God? What shall we say, when <hi>Israel</hi> turneth his back, saith <hi>Joshua.</hi> They have sinned saith God, there is an accursed thing among them. A most vile and cursed thing it is to quench the spirit, and while this is among a people, they can never stand, but must needs be overcome by every temptation.</p>

It may bee they draw thee to gaming, and then cry out upon thee for an Hypocrite. Now what a vile thing is this? Thou shouldest cut off all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from those that seek an occasion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of cutting off, thou by this means cuttest out an occasion.

But besides this, there is that which is worse; they take an occasion hence to reproach Religion it self, and all that profess it. <hi>They are all alike,</hi> say they, And in this thou dost more mischief to Religion, than any of the Persecutors of it; for by their Persecuting of it, they can never make it to bee ill thought of, as thou dost by thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary walking to it.</p>

These have a mighty advantage upon some, and upon all, even the best in some cases, <hi>viz.</hi> those wherein the spirit is quenched. For the spirit being quenched, lusts and corruptions are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and lusts and corruptions being kindled, the things of the world have such an advantage, as that they prove, not only very tempting, but very prevailing things: in somuch, that they bring men to be, and to do any thing, though never so vile, for the getting of them, and for the keeping of them, when they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

                  <p>Now see the evil of it.

Oh then consider, knowest thou not, that thou art not thy own and that thy body is a member of <hi>Christ?</hi> and wilt thou take the members of <hi>Christ,</hi> and make them the members of an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot?

Oh how is it that thou canst not say, this love that I give to the World is <hi>Christs,</hi> these thoughts, these affections, this time, this care, this earnestness, and endeavour about the things of the world, they are all <hi>Christs,</hi> and shall I give that which is <hi>Christs</hi> to the world? Again consider, is not enmity against God, evil? Why, this is enmity against God. <hi>Ye Adulterers and Adulteresses, know you not that the friendship of the World is enmity with God? Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God, Jam.</hi> 4.4. Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> 1 John. 2.15. <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him, i. e,</hi> he loves not the Father, nor the Father him. Oh consider then, thou sayest thou lovest God, but how canst thou say thou lovest him, when thy heart is not with him? For the world has thy heart, and thou lovest thy pleasures, and thy profits more than God. Again, consider yet, Is not Idolatry evil? Why, this makes thee an Idolater; the covetous worldling, the scripture saith, is an Idolater. Thou dost not worship I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100920:82"/> thou art not for Service and Ceremonies; but what saith the <hi>Apostle?</hi> thou that abhorrest Idols, dost thou commit Sacriledge?

It is sent as the other two for quenching of the spirit. It consists in two things, the wasting and pining away of gifts, &amp; common grace.

                  <p n="3">3. It brings a Consumption of the soul, and this is worst of all. Many of those that quench the Spirit, prosper in their estates, and thrive in their bodies, but consume in their souls. Their bodies prosper, but their <hi>souls do not prosper;</hi> they have fat bodies, but lean souls, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.15. <hi>They lusted exceedingly in the Wilderness, and God gave them their request, but sent leanness into their souls, i. e.</hi> while they inordinately desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red meat for their bodies, God with-held the ordinary food of their souls; so that, though they had fat bodies, they had starvling souls.

                  <p>This Consumption, or leanness of soul is seen in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the wasting and pining away of their Gifts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the wasting and pining away of their common Graces.</p>
                  <p>Many Professors there are that have had gifts of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> gifts of <hi>Utterance,</hi> so that they have been able to apprehend the deep things and Mysteries of the Gospel, able to speak <hi>a word in season,</hi> even to the <hi>ravishment</hi> of the hearers; able to pray with great enlargement, even to the <hi>heart-breaking</hi> of those that joyned with them; but for some secret Apostacy, and back-sliding, whereby they have quench'd the Spirit, God hath blasted these precious gifts, and now they are become very dull and stupid, are blinde, and not able to discern any thing, and altogether useless, and unprofitable to others, like unsavoury salt, good for nothing, but to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100920:85"/> bee thrown out to the Dung-hill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As their gifts are consumed, so are their graces. Time was, when they had <hi>a taste of the Heavenly gift,</hi> abundance of joy, and zeal, and their hearts melted within them for the Commission of sin, but now their hearts are withered and shrivled up. They seemed before to have some life, but now, though they had a name to live, yet they are seemingly dead, it may be really so too. Of these <hi>Jude</hi> speaks <hi>vers.</hi> 12. Thus we may observe it in many, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have much of the good favour of the knowledge and grace of <hi>Christ</hi> in them, but now are become very unsavory, having lost their former sense and apprehensions of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>beauties of Holiness.</hi> Thus you see how quenching of the Spirit procures a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, as the meritorious cause, by provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God to inflict it.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, it works and effects it of it self. As when natural heat is quenched, a bodily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption follows, as the effect of it; So when Spiritual heat is quenched, when the fire of the Spirit is extinguished, there follows a spiritual Consumption. The life of any thing consists in its spirits, as you have heard; so much as you waste the spirits, so much you impair the life. When Graces are not exercised, they languish
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100920:86"/> and decay, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. their graces were not acted and kept in continual exercise, in the works they did, and in the duties they perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and so were <hi>ready to dye.</hi> As 'tis with our <hi>natural spirits,</hi> when a man sits still for the most part, and doth not employ himself, he grows listless and indisposed, lumpish and dull; so 'tis with <hi>these supernatural. He that is sloathful is brother to a great waster, Prov.</hi> 18.9. there will be a losing of one degree after another, till at length there be nothing almost left, and that, <hi>ready to dye too.

                  <p>See then further from hence, what an evil there is in quenching the spirit, that it brings thee into a spiritual Consumption. Oh if thou didst rightly apprehend it, if thou didst consider the danger of it, thou wouldst presently cry out, <hi>O my leanness, my leanness! Woe is me.</hi> As those that are sensible of their danger, by reason of a bodily consumption, they will go to this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, and that Physician, and say, what's good for mee? I am afraid I am in a Consumption, and must dye: So thou wouldst go up and down, crying out: <q>Oh! what shall I do to be saved, to be recovered, to be delivered from this death?

                  <p>To conclude, take these distinctions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Consumption.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is either <hi>Partial,</hi> or <hi>Total.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Partial,</hi> as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.31. <hi>Thou didst not utterly consume them;</hi> So it may be, God doth not utterly consume thee for this year, nor for this or that sin; but yet there is a partial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption upon thee. <hi>The Plague is begun,</hi> the disease is begun that's like e're long utterly to consume thee, only God spares thee for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And this he doth, to shew his patience and long-suffering towards thee, not willing that thou shouldest dye, but rather, that thou shouldest be renewed again unto repentance, and live.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Total,</hi> As when the Disease is universally and wholly over-spread; when not onely, this or that particular part, but all and every part is consumed. 'Tis sad when there is a Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any one part of the body, or estate, but when 'tis universal, this is miserable. So 'tis in spirituals. As there may sometimes bee a growth in one lust more than in others; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in graces, there's a growth in one grace, when another grace seems to be even consumed and wasted to nothing: And again, there is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100920:87"/> a Consumption in all the graces; so that a man in respect of spirituals, is wholly dead, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all left, whereby to judge of any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is either <hi>gradual</hi> or <hi>at once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Gradual,</hi> when a mans gifts and grace wasts by little and little. As Christians that are in a thriving condition are <hi>renewed day by day,</hi> and go <hi>from strength to strength,</hi> from a lesser to a greater degree of strength continually; so Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites that are fallen into a consumption, they fall away from one degree to another, from a greater to a lesser.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. At once, <hi>The Lord said unto Moses, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aaron, separate your selves from among this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that I may consume them in a moment, Numb.</hi> 16.20, 21. So God smites a man some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a sudden judgement, and cuts him off at once, As <hi>Abishai</hi> said, <hi>and I will not smite him the second time.</hi> A man sometimes is struck dead by, and for <hi>one</hi> sin.

                  <p n="3">3. There is a Consumption in this life, and in the life to come.

                  <p>It is from being luke-warme then, and from being cold, then men put out the fire of the spirit in themselves, that they are idle, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy, and sloathful, and do not follow their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with diligence. One that is spiritual makes conscience of redeeming the time, and of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the work God hath given him to do: wherein he is called, he will therein abide with God; and not onely so, as not wholly to give over, but so, as not to give it over for a time, <hi>viz.</hi> such time as God requires he should abide with him in it.

Then he is for smoaking and drinking rather than working; foolish talking and jesting, hearing and telling of news, and idle tales and stories, are far more pleasing and delightful: and he will busie himself about any thing, rather than that which is his business; how often art thou idling at the work-house, while thy heart is at the Play-House? How often art thou tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling in the shop, while thy minde is at the Ale-house? <hi>The heart of fools is in the house of mirth,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Eccles.</hi> 7.4. and so is thine; and therefore thou canst not endure to abide at thy work.

                  <p>Now see what evil this is, that thou shouldst be thus hindred from working in thy particular calling, I say <hi>thus</hi> hindred. For to be hindred by forcible restraint, or by sickness or weakness, is onely thy affliction, but to be thus hindred, <hi>viz.</hi> by a spirit of sloathfulness (as when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is quenched thou art) this is thy sin. And it is a very great sin. The <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it <hi>disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly walking,</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.11. and the <hi>Prophet</hi> tells, that it was one of the sins of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> for which God destroyed them by fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49. <hi>Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fulness of bread, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of idleness was in her, and in her Daughters.</hi> Mark it, <hi>abundance of idleness.</hi> Thou scarce thinkest idleness (it may be) to be a sin, at least, to be so hainous a sin; but had it not been so hainous, it would not have been so provoking; so provoking as to have procured such a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vengeance to bee inflicted upon the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> as thereby to be <hi>set forth for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of suffering the vengeance of eternal fire, Jude</hi> 7.

See then what an evil the neglect of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings is: and see what an evil your

You want not many times abilities, nor opportunities, but when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is quenched, you want affections; you love not such duties, you delight not in them. Your affections are all gone. <hi>First,</hi> your <hi>affections of liking</hi> are gone. Your love is gone, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire gone, your delight gone. Your affections of liking are all gone in respect of what is good. Time was, when you could say: <hi>My soul thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63.1, 2. but now you are ready to say, <hi>depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy waies.</hi> Time was, when you counted it all joy to have an opportunity; O blessed season! O welcome hour! and your heart did revive, and even leap within you at the very first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a good duty; I but now it causeth even a kinde of <hi>heart-qualm</hi> to come upon you, so that your affections of liking are gone, in respect of what is good. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> your <hi>affections of disliking</hi> gone too, in respect of what is evil. Your hatred gone, your fear gone, your god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sorrow, godly shame, and holy indignation gone. Time was, when you even loathed and abhorred such and such evils: You could not endure the thinking, much less the naming of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100920:91"/> them; you thought they should not be <hi>so much as named amongst Saints,</hi> much less acted; I but now, you are so far from loathing and abhorring them, that you do secretly like them, nay, are ready to express it by speaking and pleading for them. Time was, when you feared the least occasion that might lead you to the commission of such and such sins, but now you are bold and venturous, you are not afraid at all. Time was, when, if you had committed such a sin, it was a grief of heart, yea, even a heart-breaking to you, and you were greatly ashamed, yea, even confounded in your selves; but now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of grieving, you rejoyce; instead of being ashamed, you glory, and make your boast. Time was, when you were angry, <hi>yea, what indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was there?</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks; but now you are grown very milde and meek; Oh deal gently with <hi>Absolom</hi> for my sake, deal gently with such a sin, such a lust, if it be reproved, you know not how to bear it, nay, if it be not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced and respected; if you be not flattered and soothed up in it, you cannot bear it. So that all your affections of disliking, in respect of what is evil, are gone too.</p>

                  <p>Thus it is when you have quenched the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, your affections are gone, so that you have no minde, no heart, either to the performance
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100920:92"/> of your duty, or the opposing of your sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto. And it cannot be otherwise, for where there's no affection, there's no will. You cannot be willing to that, that you do not love, nor desire, nor delight in: nor unwilling to that, that you do not hate nor fear, and which you apprehend will neither be grief, nor shame unto you. This then must needs be a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to your working. Oh there is nothing to a willing minde, we say: Where there is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness there will be doing; a will is <hi>all in all</hi> for the most part. But on the contrary, where there wants a will, there nothing will be done. Nothing but upon force and constraint, and so I grant, that upon some terrible convictions, and frightful providences, whereby thou art made afraid of the wrath and vengeance of God, thou mayest be willing; so <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, so <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> was, and <hi>did many things,</hi> because he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: but such doings last not long. When <hi>Pharaoh saw there was respite,</hi> he returned to his obstinacy again: and so <hi>Herod,</hi> so thou. This is but a violent motion, and nothing violent is perpetual; so that this must needs bee a great hindrance to your working that you want a will. And whence is it, but from your quenching of the Spirit?</p>

                  <p>That you want a will, that you want affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100920:92"/> powerfully and sweetly to constrain you to do what God requires, I say it is from your quenching of the spirit. Oh saith <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is willing, but the flesh is weak.</hi> If you had the spirit, if you were <hi>fervent in spirit,</hi> then you would be full of love, full of desire, full of joy, and delight; if you were spiritual, you would be all for spiritual things, nothing would be so pleasing and acceptable to you; <hi>Did not our hearts burn within us?</hi> said they, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> now what was the effect of it? why, they would not let <hi>Christ</hi> depart; he made as if he would be gone, but they constrained him to tarry. Oh his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, his preaching was so sweet, they could never have enough of it. Thus it would be, if the spirit were not quenched, you would <hi>not dispise prophesying, praying, conference,</hi> &amp;c. no, but you would prize them exceedingly, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good thing whatsoever. Thus it is when the spirit is not quenched. But when the spirit is quenched, then the stream of your affections is turned, and runs the quite contrary way, to the works of sin, the works of the flesh. Then you <hi>will</hi> be rich, you <hi>will</hi> go to such and such a place, to buy, and sell, and get gain; whether God <hi>will</hi> or no; you never consider of that. Instead of being with the godly, you <hi>will</hi> be with the wicked, instead of frequenting Church-assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, you will forsake the assembling of your
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100920:93"/> selves together, though it be the drawing back to perdition. Though Conscience call upon you never so much from within, and your Minister never so much from without, to bee instant in season and out of season, to watch, and pray, and hear, and strive, and endeavour to your utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, yet you will not endeavour any thing; and how can it be otherwise while you want affection? Pray, it may be, you do once a day, or twice a day, perhaps now and then with the Family, but scarce once in two or three daies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by your selves. The pretence is want of light, you are not convinced it is a Duty, but what is the cause? Is it not want of Love? want of affection? <hi>Oh how I love thy Law,</hi> said <hi>David, it is my meditation all the day long.</hi> If you did love, you would pray; Why? hast thou not as much light as <hi>David?</hi> as <hi>Daniel?</hi> nay, thou hast more, but here's the misery, or rather the mischief, thou hast not <hi>as much love.</hi> Therefore thou a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t so far from praying three times a day, that thou scarce prayest three times a week. And is not this from thy quenching of the spirit? Oh remember the spirit is willing; if any thing be weak or unwilling, it is the flesh. Thus you see, that quenching of the spirit hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders you by dis-affecting you, so that you will not if you could. 'Tis not because you cannot, when you do not work in your general Calling,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100920:93"/> when you stir not up your selves, and labour not more abundantly, (you have abilities, you have opportunities;) but because you will not. <hi>You will not come,</hi> saith <hi>Christ, that you might have life.</hi> you say: <hi>We are Lords, we will not come at thee.</hi> This the effect of your quenching the Spirit. Sometimes indeed, even when the spirit is not quenched, there may be some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of spiritual activity for a season, as in case of bodily infirmity, or other necessity, but then there is desire, as in <hi>David,</hi> who longed to be at the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> when he could not come thither; but when the Spirit is quenched, then the abatement is voluntary, and the heart wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly laies down the strength of holy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and a man cannot in this case because hee will not; <hi>i. e.</hi> because he hath lost his affection. His quenching of the Spirit dis-affects him, so that he will not, if he could.</p>

It doth not onely take away your <hi>will,</hi> but your <hi>power,</hi> or if it doth not take away your will, yet it doth your power. <hi>To will is present</hi> it may be, (though that is rare) but how <hi>to perform you know not,</hi> when you have quencht the spirit. If you have convictions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as sometimes you have, so that you resolve to make trial of your strength, yet when it comes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100920:94"/> to the tryal, you can do nothing; like wounded men, that trie to rise, but they fall down present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again; offer to strike, but their blow fails in the mid-way. <hi>Sampson</hi> thought he could have done as before, but hee wist not that the Spirit was departed from him. Hee had done great and wonderful things by his strength, while he had the spirit, had slain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Philistims</hi> came upon him, and bound him, and put out his eyes, and made him grinde in a Mill; and the Text saith, he <hi>wist not that the spirit was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from him.</hi> So you, while the Spirit is with you, you are able to do great things for God, able to denie your selves, and perform the most difficult duties, the most tedious and irksome duties to flesh and blood, able to resist strong temptations, and to overcome strong corruptions; but when the spirit is departed from you, you are able to do nothing. You think you will do at such a time as formerlie, hear as formerlie; pray as formerlie; but you know not that the spirit is departed from you, and that therefore you cannot do it. As Old men they think they will do, as they could when they were Young, but they consider not, that natural heat is decaied. When natural
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100920:94"/> heat and vigour decaies, a man cannot go, nor ride, nor work as before; so here, when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is quenched, principles are decaied; action must needs decay too.

Nay 'tis seldome the Spirit is so quenched in Professors, as that a man gives over all, and does nothing; sometimes it is so indeed that a man falls quite away, being <hi>twice dead,</hi> and withered up by the roots, being so far from bearing any good fruit, from having <hi>one or two berries in some of the uttermost branches,</hi> that he hath not so
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100920:96"/> much as <hi>one leaf of profession</hi> left. But though this be sometimes so, and there are now and then some rare Examples of it; yet ordinarily we see, that people keep their <hi>forme of godliness,</hi> though they lose the <hi>power of it;</hi> and those that have a <hi>forme of godliness,</hi> will do something; as pray in the Family, sometimes read the Word, and pray alone by themselves, and frequent publick Ordinances.</p>

                  <p>This is the custome generally of all sorts of Professors, to be exercising themselves (in some manner or other) in the practice of some duties or other of Religion, though the spirit be never so much quenched in them; of publick Duties especially, because else, there would be no face or appearance of Religion in their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and therefore all (we see) do something or other, though they be otherwise <hi>earthly and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,</hi> many of them having not the Spirit.</p>

                  <p>It must be granted then that even where the Spirit is quenched, there may be <hi>Working.</hi> Nay sometimes there may be <hi>working</hi> and striving, where the spirit is quenched (as I said) very much. Even such persons may have great and powerful convictions still left, great fears and terrours in their Consciences: or there may be some stinging affliction upon their persons, or
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100920:97"/> relations, or estates, and these may put them upon working and striving very hard. As <hi>Saul</hi> (you know even after the spirit was departed from him, he <hi>works hard</hi> in time of his distress) runs from Duty, to Duty, from Ordinance, to Ordinance to seek God: Seeks by <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> and <hi>Dreams,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6. Yea, God tells of people that have sinned to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding height, in casting his word behinde their backs, and quenching the motions, and resisting the strivings of his Spirit; that yet in time of their distress, when tribulation and anguish comes upon them, will seek him early and cry unto him for mercy and pardon, as you may see, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.27, 28.

                  <p>But now Beloved, pray mark; Though they labour and strive, and <hi>work</hi> never so much, yet in this case, while the Spirit is quenched in them, 'tis as if they did not labour or <hi>work</hi> at all.

                     <hi>Saul</hi> sought several waies, but, saith he, <hi>God answers me no more.</hi> And you may see how God threatens those <hi>Quenchers of the Spirit, Prov.</hi> 1.28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Those also, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.2. They did many things, took delight in approaching to God, fasted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they thought very well of what they had done, they thought they were good works, and that they deserved by the doing of them; but their quenching of the spirit made all of none effect, God took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, he regarded them not; as they most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly complain, <hi>Wherefore have we fasted, and thou takest no knowledge, &amp;c.</hi> They fasted, but it was not <hi>such a Fast as God had chosen;</hi> So that though they were not hindred from <hi>working,</hi> yet their <hi>work</hi> was hindred. So you, Beloved, though your quenching of the Spirit, doth not wholly take you off from Duties, from <hi>Praying, Hearing, Meditating,</hi> and other religious duties, but you practice them still, and perhaps at times, do more than ordinarily busie your selves in them: though this be so, I say, that it doth not wholly take you off from <hi>working</hi> in these and other Duties, yet it hinders your <hi>work</hi> in them. It hinders the work that should be done, and it hinders the work that is done; So that 'tis in effect, as if you did nothing at all in such Duties, it may be in some respect far worse.</p>

                  <p>There is a two-fold perfection.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There's a perfection in opposition to that that is <hi>counterfeit.</hi> So that that hath its essential parts, whatever essentially belongs unto it, is perfect.

                  <p n="1">1. You can do nothing perfect, in opposition to what is counterfeit. As <hi>Christ,</hi> told them of <hi>Sardis,</hi> that he had not <hi>found their works perfect before God, Rev.</hi> 3.2. No, for they were Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, having <hi>a name to live, but were dead,</hi> and therefore their works were dead too; they were not filled up with the lively actings of Grace, and so were dead works. And this was through their quenching of the Spirit, there were <hi>things that remained,</hi> but they were <hi>ready to dye.</hi> Thus it is with you, sirs, when you quench the Spirit: then all you do is counterfeit and Hypocritical. It may look like a good work, but it is evil. It is not a good work, it doth but only seem to be so. There's a two-fold goodness in every good work.</p>
                  <list>

                  </list>
                  <p>Now the outward goodness without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is nothing. Duties may be outwardly fair, but without the inward goodness, there's no
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100920:99"/> perfection in them, they are but <hi>Pharisaical</hi> and <hi>Hypocritical.</hi> There is the Hypocrisie of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Hypocrisie of an action. Works and Actions without the inward goodness, are but <hi>Pharisaical,</hi> or <hi>Hypocritical.</hi> The inward goodness of Duties is the <hi>spiritualness</hi> of them. If that be wanting, how fair and amiable, or lovely soever they be in outward appearance; they have no goodness in them; and this must needs bee wanting when the Spirit is quenched. If the Spirit be quenched in the <hi>habit,</hi> it must needs be quenched in the <hi>operation</hi> also; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no spiritualness in your actions at such a time. And what bee they then? They are but flesh. If they be not works of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they are the works of the flesh (for one, or the other they must needs be.) Now works of the flesh are not good works. And not onely Drunkenness, Swearing, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hearing, Reading, Repeating of Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are works of the flesh, if without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Oh consider this; let it sink into your hearts. The fire of the Spirit is quenched, and that hinders the perfection of your works in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to that which is counterfeit. You may perhaps think you do well, but the thing you do is not of the right kinde. There is that like to gold, that is not gold; your gold is but Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. When the Spirit is quenched, you can do nothing perfect, in opposition to that that is defective. But may it not be said of the most spiritual actions that they are not thus perfect? though there be never so much of the Spirit, is there not defectiveness in them? Yes, but not such as is opposed to integrity, such as ariseth from quenching of the spirit. See for this, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14. There <hi>Christ</hi> tells of the seed that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Thorns, meaning thereby Hearers, that choak the Word and Spirit by earthly and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Lusts, that they <hi>bring forth nothing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> There is something indeed towards it, as there is in the seed that springs among thorns, there is the blade, and somewhat like an ear; but it doth not ripen unto perfection. It is like the Corn that groweth upon the house tops, <hi>wherewith the Mower filleth not his hand,</hi> there is something or other still wanting in their Duties. <hi>Christ</hi> saith to such souls, as to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Sardis, I have not found thy works perfect before me.</hi> There is a two-fold perfection, before men, and before God. Your works may be perfect before men; I finde such an ones work perfect, may an eminent Christian say, but so doth not <hi>Christ;</hi> I do not finde it perfect before me, saith <hi>Christ.</hi> When the Spirit is quenched every thing is defective. There are many things
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100920:100"/> lacking in all the Duties thou performest, thou offerest the blinde, and the lame unto God; that which is rent, and torne, and mangled, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentest to him: thou comest with clipt, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd Duties, just as poor men pay their debts, in clipt mony, broken groats, any thing they can get. And no wonder, slothfulness and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallity can produce no better. If thou hast quencht the spirit, every thing thou dost is marr'd in the doing, thou spoilest whatever thou takest in hand.</p>
                  <p>When thou wantest abilitie or opportunitie to work, thou supposest, that if thou could'st but work, thou should'st do something; but now thou triest and canst do nothing. If a man have never so good materials to work upon, yet if he have not that which is necessary to work by, then he can make nothing of it. If an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer be without fire, he cannot form his Iron into any thing as he should, because hee wants that whereby it should be done. So it is with a Professor, when he hath put out the fire of the spirit; he hath excellent gifts, precious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and advantages, but he can make nothing of his duties, because he wants the spirit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he should do them, and without which they cannot possiblie bee done. Without the spirit wee can do nothing. That <hi>helps our infirmities,</hi> else we have so many infirmities that we can do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100920:100"/> nothing. Oh consider, you are to be working continuallie, all the day long, and so it may be you are, but if the spirit be quenched, you do no work. You work, and yet do no work, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith of them, 2 <hi>The.</hi> 3.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they were very busie, yet did nothing. Children are very busie all day long, and take great pains according to their strength, yet do nothing; so you without the spirit. You cannot do any work without the spirit, but what is a work of the flesh. You cannot do the works of God. Therefore at such a time every thing you do is spoiled.</p>

                  <p>Now I beseech you consider the evil of this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When any thing you do is spoiled, you can take no comfort in it, you are troubled to think of it. So here, you lose the comfort, and are troubled to think of what you do. It is said of God, all his works are perfect, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good they appear when reflected on; but when thou reflectest on what thou hast done, all appears exceeding bad, stark naught; there being so much of the flesh, and nothing of the spirit to be found in it. Hence thou concludest thou art not a good Tree, because thou bearest not good Fruit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou must undo all that thou hast done. All that hath been mis-done, must bee undone.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100920:101"/> Thou must pluck up what thou hast planted, pull down what thou hast built up; <hi>i. e.</hi> thou must repent of it, that whereas others must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their sins, their prophaneness, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, uncleanness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou must repent of thy duties, thy praying, hearing, and attending on Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And how sad is this!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thou must do all over again. Repent, and do thy first works; all that thou hast done, stands for nothing; they are but so many Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Thou maiest now pray and hear, as if thou hadst never praied and heard, and so do other duties, as if thou hadst never done them at all. Believe again, repent again, be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thou gainest nothing by what thou dost, no more than a man getteth by counterfeit monie when discovered.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is great folly to begin and not bee able to finish, not to bring to perfection.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It brings a curse. <hi>The wicked work a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful work,</hi> God curseth such as do his work deceitfullie. <hi>Cursed be the deceiver that offers to God a corrupt</hi> or maimed <hi>thing.</hi> And thus of the first particular, to shew how this sin of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spirit, doth hinder your work in respect of the perfection of it.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. It hinders your work in respect of the <hi>acceptance</hi> of it. And this doth necessarily follow upon the former; your works being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, God will not accept them. Therefore <hi>Christ</hi> bids the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Church of Ephesus</hi> repent, because he had not found his works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God. God will not accept of flesh instead of spirit. <hi>They that are in the flesh cannot please God.</hi> And works of the flesh are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to him. But all your works, if they be not the works of the spirit, are (as you have heard) works of the flesh, and therefore must needs be an abomination to God. God is a Spirit, and seeketh for such to worship him, as worship him in Spirit and in Truth. If not in spirit, not in truth; your worship is but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, therefore he will not accept it. <hi>We put no confidence therefore in the flesh,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>worship God in the Spirit. Phil.</hi> 3.3. Many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons put great confidence in their Duties, not considering they are but flesh, and so, that in being confident of them, they do but put confidence in the flesh, which is vain confidence. We have no ground to put confidence in that which God will not accept; but he will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of flesh, therefore not of those Duties that are not spiritual, in which the fire of the spirit is quenched. God would not accept of any
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100920:102"/> fire but that which came down from Heaven, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were punished for offering <hi>strange fire.</hi> God will not accept of any fire but the fire of the spirit, all other fire is strange fire; if that therefore be quenched, then though we do never so much, God doth not regard it, nay he loaths and abhorres it. The <hi>Apostle Heb.</hi> 9.14. distinguisheth betwixt <hi>dead works,</hi> and the <hi>service of the living God.</hi> Dead works are not the service of the living God. Now your works without the spirit, are dead works. The Spirit is the only principle of life, both in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and actions. Persons without the spirit are dead, and so are actions. You know an Engine doth work as well as a living Creature, and doth a great deal of work; but there's a great difference betwixt their work, and the work of living Creatures, that work from an inward principle. So many Professors do a great deal of work, but they are acted by plummets, and external weights, and therefore their works are dead works. The works of an Engine are dead works, only the works of living Creatures are living works.</p>

It may be thou canst hear this without any regret of Conscience now, but when Conscience comes to be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how wilt thou be able to bear it, that God doth not accept of thy works?

The sweetest and fullest communion that Saints have on this side Heaven, is that which they have in Ordinances.

Is it not from thy quenching of the spirit? for if the spirit were not quenched, God would bee Friends; but the spirit being quenched, hee is vexed, yea, vexed to the <hi>very heart, Gen.</hi> 6.6. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is thy Enemy. God is out with thee for the sin of thy nature; by nature thou art a

The spirit comes, and leaves the truth upon record in the Conscience; Oh Sinners, saith he, Know, that though I might justly damn, yet I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pardon thee, so that thou wilt repent, and therefore <hi>turn thee, turn thee, why wilt thou dye?</hi> But now, seeing thou wilt nor turn, hee is much more thy enemy than before; he is an enemy to thee, not onely for sin against the Law (as before) but now for sin against the Gospel. Now thou sinnest against the Gospel, despisest the riches of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. and therefore hee is much more thine enemy now, than ever before. Before 'twas only for sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Covenant of works; but now for sinning against the Gospel, the Covenant of grace.</p>

Thou won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest thou hast no more peace; Oh! consider, is it not hence, that thou quenchest the spirit? Sinnest against light? dost not exercise grace? dost not perform duties? 'Twould be a wonder thou should'st have any peace in such a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If thou hast any, it will not last. Every act of quenching the spirit, is a deadly wound to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100920:127"/> thy peace, which thou feelest not alwaies for the present, but thou dost afterwards. Thou might'st enjoy thy self as much as any, if thou would'st but follow the motions of the spirit; but thou dost not, and therefore hast no more comfort in thy self; but what ever troubles thee, art troubled at thy self most. Oh what an enemy art thou to thy self! why, what ayles thee? who, or what is it that molests thee? Is it not thy own doing? has not thy wickedness, thy quenching of the spirit procured this unto thee? Conscience tells thee of such a sin thou shouldst not commit; but thou committest it, and then peace is gone, as soon as ever it is committed: The spirit calls upon thee for such a duty, but thou neglectest it, and then peace is gone as soon as ever it is neglected. And now thou callest in question all from the beginning to this day: art ready to curse the day wherein thou wert born. Knowest not whether thou shalt go, to Heaven, or to Hell; darest not think of Judgement, or if thou dost, a fit of trembling (such as <hi>Foelix</hi> was surpriz'd with) present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes upon thee. Now as 'tis in a State or Kingdome, if the peace of the State or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be broken, it is accounted a great evil, and that both in respect of evils fear'd and felt; then all things hang in doubt before us, all goes to ruine, there is no thriving or flourishing of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100920:128"/> any thing, as in times of peace: So 'tis in the Soul, when peace of Conscience is broken. And why then canst thou not see what an evil there is in that, that is the cause of it? Oh thy mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! when all is in peace without, then thou hast no peace within: when all the Countrey round about is quiet, then thou art in miserable trouble. But besides, when there is trouble without, thou hast trouble within too, <hi>without are fightings, within are fears,</hi> and this is far worse than outward trouble. Let trouble without be never so great, yet if all bee quiet within, a man can <hi>say</hi> and <hi>sing,</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> 46.1, 2. <hi>but a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed spirit who can bear?</hi> A little wind within, in the bowels of the earth, will cause a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, whereas all the four winds without can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not stir it. <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, than with a brawling wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in a wide house.</hi> It may bee said also, it is better to dwell there, than in a palace with a <hi>brawling Conscience.</hi> Oh what duties dost thou perform in the mean time? is it not meerly in form? and for fashions sake, because thou would'st honour thy self before the people, that thou hearest, and prayest and performest other duties of Religion? for thou dost not think they are accepted, yet thou holdest on still, but 'tis to no purpose. Oh why dost thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of making thy peace? wilt thou still go on
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100920:128"/> in this condition? why dost thou not leave off thy quenching of the spirit, that thou mightest be at peace and have rest? Oh the folly and madness that thou art guilty of, that sufferest so much as thou dost, and yet hast not an heart to leave off that, that is the cause of thy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!

                  <p>See then the fearful estate, and the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition thou art in, while thou quenchest the spirit. Thou hast no revivings, no quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; thy heart doth not <hi>burn</hi> within thee: thou hast enlightnings, no enlargements, no sealings, no assurances. Thou art under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and prevailings of thy lusts still; as unable to deny thy self as ever, notwithstanding all the Sermons thou hast heard, all the Sabbaths thou hast kept, all the Sacraments thou hast had, all the Prayers thou makest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thy Hearing is in vain, thy Praying in vain, Sacraments
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100920:131"/> are in vain; Counsels, Admonitions, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are all in vain. Thou Hearest, but dost not understand; seekest, but dost not finde; knockest, but none opens unto thee. So the <hi>Spouse</hi> found after that shee had quenched the spirit. God answers thee not, takes no notice of thee; though thou makest many prayers, cryest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so long, never so loud, God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it. This quenching of the spirit is the bane of all. Hence it is that nothing doth thee good; hence it is that thy <hi>Minister</hi> laboureth but in vain. <hi>The Founder melteth but in vain, reprobate silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.</hi> Jer. 6.29, 30. The <hi>Jews,</hi> because they still <hi>resisted the holy Ghost,</hi> therefore were still <hi>uncircumcised in hearts and ears,</hi> Acts 7.51. the Word did not, could not work upon them. <hi>Noah</hi> was a <hi>Preacher of righteousness</hi> to the old World, but the Word did them no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they strove against the spirit. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Israel</hi> had <hi>good statutes,</hi> but they did them no good, because they <hi>rebelled against the spirit, Neh.</hi> 9.13, 20, 26. Hence Ordinances are not effectual to the <hi>converting,</hi> hence not effectual to the <hi>perfecting</hi> of many that live under them. Though they bee given purposely for this end, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.12. Yet quenching of the spirit hinders. Wouldest thou know how it doth it? Why it hinders what is necessary to be done on thy part,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100920:132"/> and that which is necessary to be done on Gods part, to make them effectual. It hinders thy prizing of Ordinances, thy minding of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, thy suitableness to Ordinances; it hinders thy beleiving, thy purging out of lusts, thy keeping out of Satan, and thus it hinders what is necessary on thy part. It hinders also what is necessary on Gods part, it hinders him from working with Ordinances, it hinders him from vouchsafing a blessing to them, nay, it provokes him to curse them to thee.</p>

                  <p>That thou mayest see then, how this quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the spirit makes the Ordinances ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; consider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If there be no prizing of Ordinances, they cannot profit; but when the spirit is quenched, Ordinances are not prized. As may be seen in the <hi>Gallatians,</hi> who, when they had quenched the spirit, lost their former apprehensions of the blessedness of the truths they had professed, and of the ordinances they had enjoyed; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begun in the spirit, they would needs bee made perfect by the flesh</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Ordinances be not minded, they cannot profit. Ordinances do not work as the meat we take, which works whether wee think of it or no; No, there must be a minding of them, or else they work not at all. But when the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100920:132"/> is quenched, there's no minding of the word, or any thing that is good, but the things of the flesh only. <hi>They that are after the spirit do minde the things of the spirit, but they that are after the flesh</hi> (having quenched the spirit) <hi>minde the things of the flesh,</hi> Rom. 8.5. their mindes and thoughts and affections are so taken up with the things of the flesh, that they cannot minde the things of the spirit. This choaks the word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.19. There's a twofold being after the flesh.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In respect of natural constitution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In respect of actual disposition.</p>
                  <p>And then, as for Ordinances, men do not minde them,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before they come, to prepare for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they come, to attend unto them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. After they be gone, to improve them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there be no suitableness to Ordinances, they do no good; because then there is no closing with them, no delight in them, for all delight ariseth from suitableness. But when the spirit is quenched, there is no suitableness, but much contrariety. <hi>Ye uncircumcised in hearts and ears, ye do alwaies resist the holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 7.51. and therefore they resisted the word.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If there bee no mixture of faith, they do not profit. <hi>The word did not profit them, beacause it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> Heb. 4.7. But when the spirit is quenched, there is no faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:100920:133"/>5. If the heart be not purged from lusts, they do not profit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6, 7. therefore 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp; Jam.</hi> 1.21. But when the spirit is quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there's no purging out of lust.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If Satan bee not kept out, they do not profit. But when the spirit is quenched, Satan cannot bee kept out, but hath free entrance. Therefore the Ordinance did not profit <hi>Judas,</hi> because Satan entred, <hi>John</hi> 13.27. Then the Devil steals away the Word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If God will not work with Ordinances, they can do no good. But when the spirit is quenched, God will not work. <hi>My spirit</hi> (saith hee) <hi>shall not alwaies strive, for that,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If God give men up to a reprobate sense, Ordinances will not work. But when the spirit is quenched, God often gives them up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate sense for their quenching of the spirit. <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9, 10. Then Ordinances do not work, <hi>John</hi> 12.39, 40. Thus you see how quenching of the spirit hinders. Hence it is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That men get no good at all by Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but are still the same that they were at first.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That others get but very little.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That others loose what they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That others get a great deal of hurt, so
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100920:133"/> that they are far worse than they were at first.</p>

God requires we should be humbled for all our omissions, and all our commissions, much more for those whereby we have quenched the spirit. He requires wee should bee humbled for every known sin, of what kinde soever it be; and that which hee requires, hee expects. Hee expects that when we have sinned, we should be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for our sins; if not, he complains, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.10. <hi>They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you, and before your fathers.</hi> Oh let not God have occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in this manner of any of us. Let him not complain first oiour sin, and then of our not being humbled for our sin; that we have grieved his spirit, and yet our spirits are not grieved for it; that we have grieved him first by quenching of the spirit, and then grieved him again, by our not grieving for it.

                  <p n="1">1. It may bee wee shall not practice it at all, but continue the omission of it still. An unhum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled heart, is an unsubdued heart, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subdued heart, is an unreforming heart.

Those <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.20. began their profession and practise of religion with joy, there was some taste of the heavenly gift, some sweetness in duties at first; but for want of a through work of humiliation, within a while all withered and came to nothing.</p>

                  <p>It is a thing of frequent and common observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in times of danger and trouble, as in sickness, and in great distress, when men have more than ordinary and strong convictions, and troubles, and fears upon their spirits, then they will purpose, and promise, it may be vow unto God, and those that come about them, that if they live and escape, they will never sin against their convictions more, as they have done, while they live; never neglect duties and ordinances, never run upon occasions, and dally with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, never neglect and disobey the motions of the spirit, as they have done, any more. But within a while, all these purposes and promises are forgotten, as if they had never been made; or if remembred, all is one, the remembrance of them doth not affect, they are now of another

Humiliation is the best foundation of reformation. And that your hearts may be affected, I mean throughly affected, call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the former particulars, both of the causes, and the effects of quenching the spirit, and then say to your selves, <q>And is it even so? are these the causes of my quenching the spirit? and are these the effects of my quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the spirit? Why then, what a world of wickedness am I guilty of! how great is the wickedness of my heart! and how great the wretchedness of my life! what abundance of evil is in me! what abundance of evil is upon me! what abundance of evil and mischief is done by me! And shall there be so much evil in mee, and I not bee humbled for it? shall there be so much evil upon me, and I not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bewail it? shall there be so much evil done by me, and I not be sorry for it?

For you are more especially bound to take care that you do not hurt your selves. You are nearer to your selves, than to others; and are more charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your selves, than with others. It was <hi>Cains</hi> sin, that he did not think he was his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers keeper; but much more that he did not think he was his own keeper. It was his sin, that he destroyed his Brothers life; but much more, that he destroyed his own life. Therefore take heed that you do not quench the Spirit in your selves. Charity begins at home, though it do not stay at home First, you are to look to your selves, and then to others.

                     <hi>Take heed to your selves, and to the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you over-seers,</hi> Act. 20.28.

                  <p n="2">2. You should not quench it in others, and therefore not quench it in your selves: Because, if you quench the Spirit in your selves, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but quench it in others also. When men love sin in themselves, they love it in others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. And when they hate and are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Spirit in themselves, they hate, and are offended with it in others also. And therefore the quenching of the Spirit in your selves, will incline and dispose you to the quenching of it in others also. Therefore seeing it is such a sin to quench the Spirit in others, and quenching it in your selves, will incline you to the quenching it in others (as hath been shewn at large already) do not quench it then in your selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Others cannot quench it in you, unless you quench it in your selves. Neither Satan, nor any of his Agents or Instruments, can do any thing, unless you will your selves. <hi>Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you;</hi> so his Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, resist them, and they will leave you.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100920:145"/> They can do nothing, unless you joyn with them; tempt they may, and perswade, and sollicite; but they can do nothing (I say) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you joyn with them; they cannot quench the Spirit <hi>in</hi> you, but <hi>by</hi> you; and therefore see that you do not quench it, and then it cannot be quenched at all. <hi>He that is born of God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself, that the wicked one toucheth him not,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Consider how unreasonable it is that you should quench it in your selves. It is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable that you should be the actors of your own hurt; but so you are when you quench the Spirit. He that quencheth the Spirit, destroyes his own self. Now, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> sayes, <hi>No man yet ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,</hi> Ephes. 5.29. So may I say, no man yet ever hated his own spirit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p>There is a fire indeed that yee ought to quench, as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The fire of Temptation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Above all taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> By these <hi>fiery darts</hi> of the wicked, are meant the Temptations of the Devil, and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby they endeavour to set your selves on fire, kindling your lusts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that so they may break forth into a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and outragious flame. And therefore, when any of these fiery darts are thrown, you must watch to quench them, that they may not kindle upon you. And for that end, above all, take unto your selves <hi>the shield of Faith.</hi> By this, he <hi>that is born of God keepeth himself,</hi> that the wicked one toucheth him not, <hi>scil.</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:100920:146"/> of these fiery darts. For if they do, they kindle presently. Behold how great a fire a little spark kindleth! therefore there must not be the least spark of Temptation, but you must endeavour presently to quench it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the fire of Sin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. <hi>The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: So is the tongue among the members, that it defileth the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and setteth on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</hi> Sometimes the Tongue, and so other members of the body, and also the powers and faculties of the Soul, are actually set on fire, so that you begin to <hi>burn in your lusts</hi> to sinful objects, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.27. The fiery darts of Temptation have hit you, and kindled upon you, so that you are set on <hi>fire of hell.</hi> Now when it is thus, you must presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to quench it. First, you should do all that you can, to hinder the kindling of this fire, and therefore withstand Temptation, keep off the fiery darts; but if that have not been done, but the fire is kindled, then you must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour what you can, to hinder the <hi>burning</hi> of it. If the fire begin to kindle never so little in your house, oh how you bestir your selves! how do you cast on all the water you can get, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why you should bee much more stirring to quench this fire. It's the <hi>fire of hell,</hi> and it will never leave burning (if it be not quenched) till it <hi>burn down
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100920:147"/> to the lowest hell.</hi> And therefore you must quench the fire of Sin, where-ever it be, in your tongue, or eye, or ear; or heart; where-ever it be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The fire of Suffering. <hi>I am come to send fire on the earth</hi> (saith <hi>Christ) and what will I, if it be already kindled?</hi> Luk. 12.49. when you come to the <hi>fiery tryal,</hi> then you must take heed you be not scorched. Afflictions and Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are compared to fire, in respect of the scorching and burning quality that is in them, as in fire; which unless it bee quenched, burns up the patience of professors, so that being not able to endure, they apostatize from their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. This fire therefore you must labour to quench, as well as the other. 'Tis said of <hi>those Believers,</hi> Heb. 11.34. <hi>That by faith they quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the violence of fire,</hi> i. e. stayed and hindred the operation and force of the fire, that it burnt not them. So the <hi>three Children</hi> did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27. And though you cannot do it miraculously, as they did, though you cannot quench the fire so, as that it shall not burn upon your bodies, yet you may, so, as that it kindle not upon your spirits, so as to scorch and torment them, but that with patience you may be able to endure it, and so hold on your profession (<hi>glorifie God in the fires,</hi> Isa. 24.5.) as if you felt it not.</p>

                  <p>These fires you are to quench, but not the fire of the spirit. The fire of temptation, and the fire of Sin are from hell; but the fire of the Spirit is <hi>from</hi> heaven, and <hi>unto</hi> heaven, and you will never come to heaven without it. As <hi>Elijah</hi> ascended in a Chariot of fire, so must you in this fire of the spirit, if ever you come thither: and therefore it must not bee quenched, but blown up into a flame, and kept flaming still more and more, that as the <hi>Angel,</hi> when the flame went up toward heaven, from off the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ascended in the flame of the Altar,</hi> Judg. 13.20. so may you. And therefore take heed it be not quenched. It is exceeding dangerous if it be quenched but a little (if there be any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, any decay of the gifts, and graces, and good motions of the spirit;) but much more, if it be utterly quenched.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Consider, if once it come to be utterly quencht, it can never be kindled again any more.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. None of the <hi>Saints</hi> can kindle it again. The <hi>wise Virgins</hi> had but enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they could spare none to the <hi>foolish Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> their companions. They can kindle grace, where there is some already, but they cannot where there is none at all. If there bee a few sparks, they may blow them up into a flame,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100920:148"/> but when all is gone out, they blow but in vain. Therefore I may say to such an one, as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 5.1. <hi>Call now, if there bee any that will answer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn?</hi> Oh then, how careful should you be! you are careful of your eyes, that your sight bee not put out, because no Physician can restore it again. You are careful of your life, because when once it is gone, there's none can restore it again. Saints may weep and mourn over one in this case, but they cannot help him. As <hi>Christ</hi> over <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> so may they mourn over thee, saying, <hi>Oh that thou hadst known,</hi> &amp;c. but now they are hid from thine eyes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None of the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> none of the means of Grace can kindle it again. <hi>Urim</hi> was nothing to <hi>Saul,</hi> when once the spirit was departed; <hi>Samuels</hi> staying with him was nothing, his mourning for him nothing, when once he had quencht the spirit. When <hi>Saul</hi> enquired of the Lord, the Lord <hi>answered him not, neither by Dreams, nor by Urim, nor by Prophets,</hi> 1 Sam. 28.6. The Word, though it be the <hi>power of God unto salvation,</hi> yet it is of no power when the spirit is quenched. The preaching of <hi>Christ</hi> himself, did those no good, that had quencht the spirit. <hi>John</hi> 12.37, 38. It you quench the spirit in your selves, you quench it in the Ordinances
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100920:148"/> also. The Word is but a dead letter to a dead heart, I mean one that is <hi>twice dead.</hi> Physick is nothing to a dead carcass. Is <hi>there no balm in Gilead?</hi> saith the <hi>Prophet, Jer.</hi> 8.22. Yes there is, but the <hi>wound</hi> of such an one is <hi>incurable:</hi> all remedies are in vain, it is impossible to <hi>recover him again to repentance,</hi> Heb. 6.6. Thus you see, if the spirit be utterly quenched, it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be kindled again.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. What fire soever else be kindled it will not avail. Men may kindle another fire, when the fire of the spirit is quenched, but it will not avail, neither for duties nor comforts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not for <hi>Duties.</hi> For all other fire is <hi>strange fire,</hi> and to offer with strange fire is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. See <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not for <hi>Comforts,</hi> Isa. 50.11. <hi>Behold all yee that kindle a fire, that compass your selves about with sparks: Walk in the light of your fire, and the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall yee have at my hand, ye shall lye down in sorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Such a fire shall be kindled by God, for the punishing of it, as shall never be quenched. When men have utterly quenched the spirit, then the fire of Gods wrath and indignation is kindled against them, and so, as it shall never be quenched. Such shall be cast into <hi>unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire.</hi> Hell fire is unquenchable fire. Men
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100920:149"/> shall never be able to quench that. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.17. Therefore <hi>Mark</hi> 9.43, 44. <hi>If thy hand offend thee cut it off, it's better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into hell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire that never shall be quenched: where their worm dieth not, where the fire is not quenched.</hi> Thus you see how it is when the spirit is utterly quenched.</p>

                  <p>Now secondly consider, if it be quenched but a <hi>little,</hi> there is danger lest it should <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> bee quenched. Every act of quenching of the spirit hath a tendency (in it's own nature) to the utter quenching of the spirit, and will certainly effect it, unless great care be had to prevent it. Any one act of quenching the spirit makes way for another, so that the more one quencheth the spirit, the more he shall; because by one act, he is the more inclined and disposed to another. It is true, that where the spirit of grace is indeed, there it can never be utterly quenched, because such an one <hi>will not</hi> utterly quench it; but a man can have no assurance of this for himself in particular, any further than he is careful not to quench the spirit at all. For if so be a man do voluntarily continue in a course of quenching the spirit; he sees there is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, and a decay of the fire in him, it is not as it was wont to be in former daies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:100920:149"/> and yet he doth not bestir himself, but rather continues to do those things still that cause it to decay and languish still more and more; if such an one in this case, think with himself, that for all this, there is no danger that the Spirit should be utterly quenched in him, he doth but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himself. That it cannot be utterly quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a <hi>Saint,</hi> is nothing to him that hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence, for ought he can see, but that he is an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> He hath therefore cause to fear, lest it should be utterly quenched e're he be aware; and 'tis well if it be not so already.</p>

                  <p>Men exhorted to beware of quenching the spirit in others. It is possible they may quench the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in others, as well as in themselves. They are very prone to quench the spirit in others, as well as in themselves. Several cases, wherein they are most prone to quench the spirit in others, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in particular. Though they do not eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally quench the spirit in any; yet if intentionally they do it, it is in the sight of God, as if they did it eventually. Though they do not intend it, yet if they do any thing, that in its own nature tends unto it, they are guilty as if they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.

Men guilty of quenching the spirit, as well by not doing that which should be done to cherish and preserve it, as by doing that which puts it out.

                  <p>HAving exhorted you to take heed of quenching the Spirit <hi>in your selves;</hi> I come now in the next place, to exhort you to take heed of quenching it <hi>in others.</hi> The Spirit must not be quenched in any. What ever the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be, yet, (if they have received the Spirit; if the fire of the Spirit be begun to be kindled in them) you must not quench it. Though you have no respect to the persons, yet you owe so much respect to the Spirit, as that you should not quench it in them. And therefore, if not for their sakes, yet for the Spirit's sake, you should not quench it. It is the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what, and where-ever it be, it must not be quenched.</p>

                  <p>Now here consider these particulars follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is possible (unless you take heed) that in others you may quench it, as well as in your selves. It is true, there are some in whom you cannot utterly quench it, as the <hi>Elect</hi> of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Christ</hi> speaking there of false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Seducers, saith, that they shall <hi>shew great signs and wonders,</hi> insomuch that <hi>(if it were possible) they shall deceive the very Elect.</hi> So that it is not possible they should be deceived, it is not possible that any should utterly quench the spirit in them. But even in such, though you cannot utterly quench the spirit in them, yet it is possible you may quench it in a great measure. Though you cannot utterly <hi>abolish</hi> the spirit in them, yet you may in a great measure <hi>abate</hi> it: Though you cannot utterly extinguish the fire, yet you may somewhat slaken the heat and fervour of it. You may deaden it much, though you cannot cause it to dye in them. As <hi>Solomons</hi> Wives, though they brought him not to an utter and final Apostasie, by their quenching of the spirit in him, yet they made him Apostatize very much for a time. <hi>They turned away his heart after other gods,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.4. It's possible therefore that even in the <hi>Elect,</hi> you may in some measure quench the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100920:152"/> spirit. But as for others, you may utterly quench it in them, as the <hi>Princes of Judah</hi> did in <hi>Joash</hi> after the death of <hi>Jehojada,</hi> 2 Chron. 24.17, 18. <hi>He did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, all the daies of Jehojada,</hi> verse 2. but after the death of <hi>Jehojada,</hi> came the <hi>Princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the King; then the King hearkned to them, and they left the house of the Lord God of their Fathers, and served Groves and Idols,</hi> verse 17, 18. Thus you see it is possible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>SECT. 3.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. You are very prone to quench it in others, as well as in your selves. It is not only a thing that you may possiblie do, but a thing that you are very apt to do. By nature you are more apt to do hurt to others, than to do them good: and you are more apt to do hurt to them this way, by quenching of the spirit in them, than any other. The flesh lusts against the spirit, as the spirit doth against the flesh, for they are contrary; so that where-ever the flesh meets with any thing of the spirit (unless it bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained) it will strive to quench it. Other things may put out the fire as well as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but there is a peculiar and special aptness in the water to put it out. So in the flesh; it's the very nature of the flesh to oppose the spirit. And therefore, so much as you are carnal, so
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:100920:152"/> much you are very prone and apt to quench that which is spiritual, what ever it be, and where ever you finde it: So that it is not enough that you quench it in your selves, but you will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to quench it in others also. The flesh will not be content, barelie with the quenching of the spirit in ones self alone, but would have it quenched in others also. As the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were not content to shut themselves out of Heaven, but they would shut out others also. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.13. Therefore you are very prone you see, to quench the spirit in others, as well as in your selves; the truth of which you shall finde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by experience. For how apt are you, some way, or other, to check that which is good in another, especiallie when you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be any way prejudicial to the interest of the flesh. As</p>

As if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers zeal and forwardness, casts shame upon your lukewarmness and backwardness; anothers knowledge, upon your ignorance; anothers bountie, upon your covetousness, anothers sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie, upon your falseness, and hipocrisie, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> in this case, how apt are you out of anger and vexation to quench it in him! Thus <hi>Cain</hi> sought to quench the spirit in <hi>Abel;</hi> wherefore was it? <hi>because his own works were evil, and his brothers
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100920:153"/> good.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.12. So <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Brother,</hi> when he came up to the Camp, and enquired what should bee done to the man that would fight with <hi>Goliah,</hi> his <hi>anger was kindled against David,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.28. <hi>viz.</hi> out of pride and envy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he should take up thoughts of combating with him, when he himself, who was his elder brother, nor any of the great worthies of <hi>Israel,</hi> durst accept of the challenge, but fled for fear, at the first sight of the adversarie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it any way cross your hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. As if any thing be imploied by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a relation to a good use, which you hoped to have fastned upon, and turned to your private advantage, how apt then out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness to let and hinder it? As when <hi>Mary</hi> annointed the feet of Jesus, said <hi>Judas, Why was not this oyntment sold for three hundred pence?</hi> which he said, <hi>not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a Thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein,</hi> John 12.6.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it any way cross your affection. As when you hate another, and any good be done unto him, how apt then, out of envy to the party, and the grudge that you bear in your heart against him, to endeavour all you can to let and hinder it? Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> because <hi>Jonathan</hi> was so kinde to <hi>David,</hi> endeavoured to quench that love he did bear to him, <hi>Thou son of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100920:153"/> and rebellious woman, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Sam. 20.30, 31.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If it be like to be an occasion of any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to another, and it be a party whom you love, then, how apt out of carnal fear, to quench it! As <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> had discovered his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> when he was like to suffer there, then out of fear, he labours to quench that good intention. <hi>Be it far from thee Lord, this shall not be unto thee, Mat.</hi> 16.22. Thus when a Childe is convinced, or an Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> discovers a resolution to do, or not to do this, or that, the doing, or not doing whereof, may possibly create some trouble, then a Parent, a Wife, a Husband, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will strive to quench it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If it any way hinder your carnal libertie, as when you would be more indulgent to the flesh in things indifferent; and anothers strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness stands in the way, then how apt, out of a love of vanitie, to quench it! or when you would abate any thing of your former professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and recede from your former principles, desiring to build again what you destroied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and anothers constancy and perseverance, is some check to your backsliding and falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; then, that you may no longer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thereby, how apt to endeavour to quench it, labouring to make him change his former principles and profession too! In these
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100920:154"/> and such like cases, you shall finde you are very apt to quench the spirit, not only in your selves, but others also. Now the more prone and apt you are, the more you should take heed.</p>

Though you be not able to effect or bring it to pass, that the spirit should be quenched in others, yet if you endeavour it, if you do any thing towards it, it is in Gods account as if you had effected it. As, though you do not actually kill a man, yet if you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, you would have done it if you could; God looks upon it, as if you had actually done it.

And therefore when you do any thing whereby the spirit is, or may (in respect of the nature of the thing done) bee quenched in any, that quenching of the spirit, whether you think of it or no, will bee laid to your charge.

                  <p>For the first of these, you may be guiltie of quenching the Spirit in others divers waies, As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By giving evil Counsel, when you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel them, either to the commission of any evil, or the omission of any good: The doing of any thing that God hath forbidden, or the forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any thing that God hath commanded. Evil counsel is very prevalent, and a great quencher of the spirit. <hi>Joash,</hi> while good <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojada</hi> was his Counsellor, did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but when the wicked Princes came to be his Counsellors, after his death, then he apostatized. By this means the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> quencht the spirit in <hi>Pilate;</hi> he had mightie convictions of the innocencie of Christ, and of the horrible evil hee should bee
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100920:156"/> guiltie of, if he condemned him, and therefore was minded to let him go; but they by their wicked counsel, prevailed against all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions. <hi>Ahaziah</hi>'s wickedness, is attributed to the counsel of his Mother, <hi>He walked in the waies of the house of Ahab, for his Mother was his Counsellor to do wickedly,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.3. He had never done so wickedlie, 'tis like, had it not been for her counsel. And therefore when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any, to, or against any thing, consider what you do. Advise to nothing rashlie, but consider well, whether it be right or no. If the counsel be good, you may do much good by it, if it bee evil, much hurt. This is one way whereby you may be guiltie of quenching the spirit in others. Another is</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By giving evil Example. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> quencht the spirit in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in <hi>Barnabas, Gal.</hi> 2.12, 13. Example is of great force: Evil example doth verie much harden in wickedness. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 54. Many that have had convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and practised accordinglie, forbearing such and such things as sinful, and hurtful to their souls, and dishonourable to their professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; yet when they have seen others practise otherwise, they have taken more libertie to themselves, and thereby defiled and wounded their Consciences. Therefore saith the <hi>Apostle, If any man see thee, which hast knowledge, sit at
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:100920:157"/> meat in the idols Temple: shall not the Conscience of him that is weak, be emboldned to eat those things which are offered to Idols?</hi> 1 Cor. 8.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You may be guiltie of quenching the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in others, by making Objections, opposing and arguing against them, in any thing that is good. Thus <hi>Elimas,</hi> the Sorcerer, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quench the spirit in the <hi>Deputy, Act.</hi> 13.7, 8. Thus the <hi>Pharisees</hi> endeavoured to quench the spirit in the blinde man, and in his parents, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.16. and so in the Officers, <hi>John</hi> 7.47.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By Judging and Censuring. Thus <hi>Eliab</hi> endeavoured to quench the spirit in <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.28.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By Scoffing and Flouting. Thus <hi>Michal</hi> endeavoured to quench the spirit in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.20.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By Reviling. Thus they endeavoured to quench the spirit in the blinde man, <hi>John</hi> 9.28.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By discountenancing and frowning upon them when they do well. Thus many Parents endeavour to quench the spirit in their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. By Threatning them. Thus the <hi>Rulers</hi> endeavoured to quench the spirit in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. By hindring them from the means of Grace. Thus <hi>Jeroboam</hi> quenched the spirit in

                  <p n="10">10. By not following the good Counsel of others, but slighting their admonitions, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their speeches, disgracing their persons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the people endeavoured to quench the spirit in <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 15.7, 9.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. By compelling others to do wickedlie. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> before his Conversion, quenched the spirit in the Disciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.11.</p>

As there are manie <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries</hi> to kindle the fire of Sin and Satan in you; so there are manie <hi>Extinguishers</hi> to put out the fire of the spirit; manie that will <hi>break the bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reed,</hi> and <hi>quench the smoaking flax.</hi>

You will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any to hurt you (in the least) if you can help it; but this is to hurt you in the greatest. He that seeks your blood, to have your blood from you, you count he seeks your life. And so hee that seeks the spirit, to have that from you, he seeks your life, and (indeed) the life of lives, your eternal life. Now will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of one who would deprive you of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral life, and not of him that will deprive you of an eternal?

You will say, you were counselled, and perswaded; but what saith the Word? <hi>Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,</hi> Psal. 1.1. And, <hi>My Son, if sinners intice thee, consent thou not,</hi> Prov. 1.10. If you have evil counsel from men, you have other counsel from God; if you follow theirs, you reject Gods, and what a charge will that be against you at the last? <hi>Oh that Israel had hearkned,</hi> &amp;c. saith God, <hi>but they would none of me,</hi> Psal. 81.11. You will say you were threatned and terrified; but what saith the Word? <hi>Who art thou, that thou shouldest bee afraid of man, whose breath is in his nostrils, and forgettest the Lord thy Maker?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 51.12, 13. Therefore <hi>the fearful and unbeleiving, shall have their part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone,</hi> Rev. 21.8. You will say you had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and president for it; but what saith the Word? See <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17, 26, 27. and <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.16. Therefore this will not excuse you.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t they do?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Perhaps you may think they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, that they mean you no hurt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:100920:164"/> do not hurt you; that they do not intend to quench the spirit in you, therefore do not quench it. But this is preposterous, to judge of mens actions by their intentions; whereas you should judge of their intentions, rather by their actions. If their Actions have a tendencie to the quenching of the spirit in you, then, what ever they intend, you may say, there's cause to beware. There's the intention of the <hi>Actor,</hi> and the intendment of the <hi>Act.</hi> The Mad man throws fire brands, and saith, <hi>Am I not in sport?</hi> Prov. 26.18, 19. but who is it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You may think with your selves, What if they do? Yet you'l look to your selves well enough. You are so well grounded and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that 'tis impossible they should ever change you. But this is to run your selves into a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; yea, it is a tempting of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a thousand to one, but you miscarrie. <hi>Christ</hi> said unto <hi>Peter, thou canst not follow me now;</hi> but <hi>Peter</hi> would not believe <hi>Christ,</hi> and therefore would needs follow into the <hi>High Priests Hall:</hi> He thought (it may bee) hee would look to himself well enough; but see the issue, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his self-confidence hee was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This is, as if a man should walk among snares, and then look to himself, that he be not intangled; whereas the best way is, to look to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:100920:164"/> himself that he do not come amongst them. Therefore the Holie Ghost prescribes this care. <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. and elsewhere.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You may think that to quench such and such particular principles and practices, is not to quench the spirit, especiallie so long as you keep up your Profession in the general. But are they principles and practises of godliness? then, to quench them, must needs be a quenching of the spirit. To quench but the least truth, the least good principle, is a quenching of the spirit. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.4-6.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. In suffering them, you do but give place to the Devil, and what a thing is that? <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath,</hi> saith the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, neither give place to the Devil, Ephes.</hi> 4.27. Now this is a giving place to the Devil; for are they not acted by the Devil? Is it not the Devil that sets them a work to quench the spirit in you? So <hi>Christ</hi> said to <hi>Peter,</hi> when he would have quencht his zeal, in resolving to suffer at <hi>Jerusalem, Mat.</hi> 16.23. Therefore he would not give place to him; <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan,</hi> saith he, thou shalt not stand in my way to let and hinder mee, thou shalt not make mee go back. You will not give place to an Enemie if you can help it, and will you give place to the Devil? No, you should resist him. <hi>Be sober,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100920:165"/> and watchful, because of your adversary the Devil, whom resist stedfast in the faith,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The more you yield to them, the more they will assault you; as you may see in <hi>Peters</hi> case, when he began (once) to yield in the <hi>high Priests</hi> Hall.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They will but glorie in your flesh, that is, in your Corruption, your Atheism, Infidelitie, carnal Fear, Hipocrisie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> boast how they have overcome you, having prevailed with you to quench the spirit; as <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. 'Tis great follie; and they do but <hi>bewitch you, Gal.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When they have quenched it, you will have no comfort nor relief from them. No more than <hi>Judas</hi> had in the <hi>chief Priests</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Mat.</hi> 27.3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Those that cannot hurt you any other way, yet may hurt you this way. As <hi>Balaam,</hi> though he could not by his enchantments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against <hi>Israel,</hi> yet this way hee did, by quenching of the spirit in them. And how hee did it, see <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.14. with <hi>Hos.</hi> 4.11.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. Consider, that <hi>stronger is the spirit that is in Gods children, than the spirit that is in the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.4. and therefore what evidence do you give of having such a spirit, if you suffer it to be
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100920:165"/> quenched in you? <hi>For we have not received a spirit of fear</hi> (saith the <hi>Apostle</hi>) but <hi>a spirit of power, of love, and of a sound minde.</hi> How then doth it appear that we have such a spirit, if we suffer it to be quenched? For</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Hereby we discover abundance of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>If thou faint in the day of adversity</hi> (and so in the day of temptation) <hi>thy strength is small,</hi> Prov. 24.10. Wherefore <hi>lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees.</hi> Heb. 12.12.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. If you suffer any to quench it in you, how do you obey that precept, <hi>of forsaking Father, Mother, Brother, Sister,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>of not living to the will of man, but of God?</hi> 'Tis not enough that you profess you must do thus, but you must do it, else all your profession is in vain.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. If you suffer them to quench the spirit in you, you suffer them to <hi>beguile you of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and to <hi>take your crown,</hi> i. e. You suffer them to undo you, and that (if they should ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlie quench the spirit in you) everlastinglie. And therefore unless you would lose your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, unless you would lose your crown, strive hard, strive that you may overcome.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Who would not strive to overcome? Is not victorie pleasing and delightful? what more delightful thing in the world? But of all victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, none more delightful than this, none in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:100920:166"/> of the glorious triumph it shall have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. See the promises, <hi>Rev. cap.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. therefore as <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. if this will not move them.</p>

                  <p n="16">16. Consider, when they have quenched the spirit in you, they may do any thing with you, make slaves and vassals of you, and so they will; as they did of <hi>Sampson, For of whomsoever a man is overcome, of the same he is brought into bondage,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.19. Therefore as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. By suffering them to quench the spirit in you, you incourage them to quench it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too; and so ruine not onlie your selves, but are the occasion of ruining manie others.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. You suffer them by the same means to ruine themselves, whereas if hee did not yield, it might be a great conviction to them, and in time (perhaps) prove their conversion.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. You see they will not suffer you to quench the spirit that is in them, that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie superstitious, sensual spirit they are acted with. Oh how will they watch against it! and strive against it, if you go about to quench it in them! And shall they be more careful of such a spirit, a worldlie, superstitious, sensual spirit? an earthlie, sensual, and devillish spirit, than you will bee of a Divine and Heavenlie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>

                     <pb n="285" facs="tcp:100920:166"/>20. Do but consider how careful you are of other fire, that it be not put out. How do you strive to keep in the <hi>Candle,</hi> when the wind is like to blow it out? how do you guard it, and cover it with your hand or garment? And will you bee so careful of that, and not as much, nay, much more careful of the spirit, <hi>the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Lord?</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> to encourage one another against the common enemie, would crie, <hi>Pro aris, &amp; focis;</hi> They would fight for their <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Hearths,</hi> that they might not be destroied.

                  <p>What is to be done then? You'l say. Why if you finde that any are Quenchers of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not affect to bee in their companie.

                  <p n="2">2. Do not affect to have them in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Say as <hi>David, Depart from me ye work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity,</hi> Psal. 6.8. <hi>A froward heart shall depart from me,</hi> Psal. 101.4. <hi>Depart from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100920:167"/> mee yee evil doers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.115.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Give no advantage to them. Remember what hath been said of giving advantage to the men of the world.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Pray hard. So <hi>David</hi> because of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.8.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Labour to discern Satan in them at the first on-set. So <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Peter, Matthew</hi> 16.23.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Earnestlie contend for the spirit, wrestle hard, as, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.12.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Beware of flatteries. Such an one is a friend, <hi>Sed magis amicus spiritus,</hi> the spirit is more a friend. <hi>Call understanding thy kinswoman,</hi> Prov. 7.4.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Remember they cannot quench it in you, but by you.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. When once you have experience of them, be not deceived twice.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Remember they are verie cunning and subtle. See <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.14. — <hi>by the slight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lye in wait to deceive.</hi>
